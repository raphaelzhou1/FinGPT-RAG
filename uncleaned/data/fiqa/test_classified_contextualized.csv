With full context: TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Japanese beverage maker Asahi Group Holdings Ltd will submit a bid as early as next week to buy SABMiller PLC’s Grolsch and Peroni beer brands for as much as 400 billion yen ($3.41 billion), the daily Yomiuri reported. If accepted, it would be the biggest overseas beverage acquisition ever by a Japanese company, topping Kirin Holdings Co Ltd’s $3.3 billion takeover of Australia’s Lion Nathan in 2009, the paper said. Asahi Holdings officials could not be reached for comment. Anheuser Busch InBev SA, which agreed to buy SABMiller for $100 billion plus, has been seeking potential bidders to buy Grolsch and Peroni, sources close to the process told Reuters last month. Peroni and Grolsch are small, premium brands and AB InBev wants to avoid getting bogged down in regulatory scrutiny over a European portfolio that already includes Corona and Stella Artois, the sources said. Indicative offers are due in mid-January, with a tight schedule for due diligence in order to clinch a deal by early March, the sources said. The sources had estimated a potential combined value for Peroni and Grolsch of about 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion), based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 120 million to 150 million euros and a possible multiple of around 12 times EBITDA.

With full context: * Money may be used to shore up dividend -analysts * Cash return was planned after Novartis asset swap deal * GSK to showcase reshaped business at May 6 investor day LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline may ditch a plan to return 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) to investors, some analysts believe, as the drugmaker prepares to set out its vision for the reshaped group and a new chairman takes the helm. Instead, Britain’s biggest drugmaker could use cash flowing in from its far-reaching asset swap deal with Novartis to support its dividend, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and Berenberg Bank. GSK said last year it intended to return 4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2015 through a so-called B share scheme, following its $20 billion-plus transaction with Novartis, which was finalised two months ago. But with the drugmaker’s dividend under pressure following several years of stagnant growth, some believe it might make more sense to cancel the programme. “Momentum behind this capital return seems to have stalled,” Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note on Friday. “With the dividend commitment under pressure, we think there is now a credible possibility the company will cancel the capital return in favour of supporting the dividend.” Scrapping the cash return could cut earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 3-4 percent. But this would be offset by renewed confidence in the dividend, which offers a fat yield of 5 percent. While the company has promised that this year’s dividend will be held at 2014’s level of 80 pence a share, there are concerns about the outlook for 2016. “Importantly, in the context of dividend yield, we believe that if GSK were to sacrifice the B share scheme, greater certainty on the dividend in 2016 and beyond might be well received by investors,” Goldman Sachs said in a note this week. A GSK spokesman said it was company policy never to comment on market speculation. The debate comes as Chief Executive Andrew Witty prepares to detail prospects for the new-look GSK at an investor day on May 6, when it will also announce first-quarter results. The company’s annual meeting a day later will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over. GSK has sold its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis, while at the same time boosting its consumer health business through a joint venture with the Swiss company and buying Novartis’s vaccines. This reduces GSK’s reliance on risky drug development and increases its exposure to more stable consumer and vaccines operations, both of which have long-lasting products but, in the case of consumer health, lower margins."

With full context: BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The proposed merger of Europe's two biggest financial market operators, London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L and Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE, poses competition issues and should also be assessed with regard to the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union, France's economy minister said on Monday. A merged group worth almost $30 billion would be similar in scale to the U.S. exchange ICE ICE.N, which has taken huge slices of Europe's derivatives markets, and would leave smaller European competitors such as Euronext Paris ENX.PA far behind. “We will assess the consequences in strategic terms for Paris’s financial center,” France’s Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Brussels. On his way to a meeting with EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, he said that the proposed deal raised competition issues. Macron, a former investment banker, also raised doubts about the impact on the merged group if Britain elected to leave the European Union in the national referendum which is expected to take place in June. “I think we should assess the possible consequences of a Brexit on such a merger,” he said, conceding that it is a matter of debate mostly for shareholders. On Friday, LSE and Deutsche Boerse said that the merged group would prosper regardless of Britain leaving the EU"

With full context: * Auto Trader shares rise 16 percent on debut * UK’s biggest listing since Royal Mail, by market value * UK’s largest-ever private equity-backed listing (Updates share price, adds comment, context, detail) LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Shares in online car marketplace Auto Trader Group rose more than 16 percent on their debut in London on Thursday after Britain’s largest ever private equity-backed listing. The flotation gave the company a market value of 2.35 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), making it also Britain’s biggest listing of any kind since the government sold shares in Royal Mail in late 2013. The company, which started out in the 1970s as a weekly magazine, went fully digital in 2013 under private equity owner Apax Partners after magazine circulation slumped. It operates Britain’s leading website for buying and selling new and used cars. The firm has focused its efforts on appealing to smartphone and tablet users, who run over 400,000 Auto Trader searches daily. Auto Trader shares rose as much as 16.5 percent from the offer price of 235 pence to almost 274 pence, and at 1515 GMT were up 15 percent. The company raised about 437 million pounds in the offer, while Apax reaped proceeds of 926 million pounds from a sale of 59 percent of the company. Including an over-allotment option for up to 15 percent of shares, Apax would be left with a holding of around 25 percent. The size of the offering is larger than usual, and far above Britain’s listing requirements of 25 percent. “They took the opportunity to reduce their overhang. They could have priced higher but they chose instead to do the bigger deal,” said a source close to the deal, referring to the unusually large proportion of shares that the fund is selling. Apax acquired 49.9 percent of Auto Trader from the Guardian Media Group in 2007 in a deal that valued the business at 1.35 billion pounds. It subsequently bought the rest of the company in 2014 for 619 million pounds. The listing follows an approach by U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman earlier this year with a potential 2 billion-pound takeover offer. Analysts raised questions about next steps for the brand, which focuses chiefly on the UK and Ireland. It generates 250 million pounds of revenue a year and employs 830 people. “It’s an online business that really does only one thing. Competitors such as eBay and Gumtree could impact that,” said Mike Butler, analyst at data provider Eagle Alpha, adding that Auto Trader is seen by some car dealerships as expensive. “One option would be a bolt-on business in the UK, like an insurance arm, to build the brand here. A new territory is a bigger undertaking,” Butler said. Money raised from IPOs is down 16 percent globally as of March 12 this year compared with the same period of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data, although the number of offerings is on a par. Last year saw a spate of private equity-backed offerings, including British retailers Poundland and Pets at Home , as funds took advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the crisis. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank are joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners, with J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley retained as joint bookrunners.

With full context: * Drugmaker’s chairman sees succession planning as priority * New CEO not expected to take over before 2017 LONDON, Feb 29 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline’s chairman is starting the process of seeking a new chief executive to succeed Andrew Witty, although a handover at the top of Britain’s biggest drugmaker is not expected before 2017. Chairman Philip Hampton has held a number of meetings with shareholders during which he has made clear that succession planning will be a priority for the board over the next couple of years, according to people familiar with the talks. Hampton is in no rush and is keen to ensure a considered and orderly transition, they added. Witty himself will play a role in finding his successor. Witty, a 31-year company veteran who has been CEO since 2008, has been under fire from some investors in the past three years as sales and profits have flagged. His reputation was further tarnished by a damaging bribery scandal in China. There have been calls from a minority of shareholders, including respected UK fund manager Neil Woodford, for a break-up of the group, with critics arguing its pharmaceuticals and consumer health units would do better as standalone businesses. Witty has conceded that spinning off the company’s large consumer healthcare division could be an option but he has argued this is not something that should happen in the short term. Over the coming year, Witty believes, GSK will demonstrate a return to growth and the consumer division will be showing improved profitability. GSK aims to double profit margins at the consumer unit, which is currently being overhauled following a complex asset swap with Novartis. GSK declined to comment on the plans to find a successor to Witty, which were first reported by the Sunday Times. The newspaper said headhunter Egon Zehnder had been asked to draw up a list of potential candidates, both internal and external. The executive search firm already works on a retained basis for GSK as a consultant on senior management appointments. Likely internal candidates could include GSK’s global pharmaceuticals head Abbas Hussain and leader of the consumer division Emma Walmsley, as well as finance chief Simon Dingemans, a former Goldman Sachs banker. Externally, GSK might try to snare a senior figure from a rival drugmaker, such as Novartis’ respected pharma head David Epstein, or else look beyond the drugs sector to an executive with broader experience in consumer products. Hampton was appointed chairman at GSK’s annual meeting in May 2015 and he said at the time he hoped Witty would remain in charge for “a good while to come”, while adding there was no hard and fast rule about how long chief executives should serve.

With full context: BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR plans to sell the eastern European assets of SABMiller SAB.L, which could fetch almost $8 billion, as it seeks European regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of its closest rival. AB InBev has already lined up Japan's Asahi Group Holdings 2502.T to buy SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.90 billion), and said on Friday it had put up for sale SABMiller's business in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. AB InBev, maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, has barely any business in eastern Europe outside Russia and Ukraine, so analysts say the sale is more about preventing regulatory delays and exiting weak spots than ensuring market competition. Beer consumption in eastern Europe has been on the decline, due to shrinking populations, weak economies and tighter regulation. That makes the region much less attractive than the growth markets of Africa and Latin America that are driving what will be the biggest deal in consumer goods history. “The eastern European markets may have provided an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction, and valuation notwithstanding, we regard this asset sale as a net positive” for AB InBev, said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham. He estimates a sale could fetch $7.75 billion, based on a multiple of 11 times expected 2016 operating earnings of $705 million, with Carlsberg CARLb.CO the most likely buyer, though it might face antitrust constraints in Poland. Molson Coors TAP.N could have antitrust trouble buying the assets, following its purchase in 2013 of eastern Europe's StarBev from CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL]. Heineken HEIN.AS might also face hurdles from competition regulators. But SAB’s business could be attractive to a private equity group or Asahi if it wanted further European expansion, analysts said. AB InBev has notified the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, which is set to deliver its verdict on the takeover of SAB by May 24. If the Commission chose to open an in-depth investigation into the SAB deal, it would not receive clearance for up to 90 working days, a delay AB InBev may be keen to avoid. AB InBev said in a statement the sale included a number of top brands in local markets, such as Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Dreher in Hungary. It said it expected considerable interest from potential buyers. The sale is conditional on AB InBev concluding its purchase of SAB, expected in the second half of this year."

With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings announced a boardroom shake-up on Friday, with the departure of three directors who had sat on the board for a combined 30 years and the arrival of two big names from European business. Europe’s biggest bank has been under pressure from some shareholders to make changes after several years of trying to turn around the business and a weak share price, prompting it to appoint headhunters in April to find new non-executive directors. HSBC said that Simon Robertson, deputy chairman, will retire after the bank’s next annual shareholder meeting, normally in April, and Safra Catz will leave at the end of this year. Rona Fairhead will also leave after the AGM, as previously announced. Paul Walsh, the chief executive of British drinks company Diageo from 2000 to 2013, will join the HSBC board in January. Henri de Castries, chairman and CEO of French insurer AXA since 2010 and its management board chairman since 2000, will join in March. HSBC has said that that its next chairman will be an external candidate, so any new director could be a replacement for Douglas Flint, who industry sources expect to step down in the next 18 months. Fairhead and Robertson are HSBC’s longest-serving non-executive directors, having sat on the board for 12 and 10 years respectively. Catz has been on the board for nearly eight years. Fairhead will hand her responsibilities as chair of HSBC North America Holdings to Heidi Miller at the end of 2015. After the changes HSBC will have 14 independent non-executive directors alongside three executive directors and the full-time chairman."

With full context: HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Saudi Aramco announced plans on Wednesday to break up Motiva Enterprises LLC in a deal that ends a partnership of nearly two decades and hands control of the biggest U.S. refinery to the Saudi state oil giant. News that the two energy companies will divide assets in their oil refining and marketing joint venture had been expected by many as they navigated an often-frayed relationship where their respective interests sometimes diverged. An early sign of a pending breakup emerged last summer when Motiva announced plans to set up its own oil products trading operation separate from Shell. The desk started up in January. The divorce also comes as the Saudi government considers selling shares in the world’s largest oil firm. Abdulrahman Al-Wuhaib, senior vice president of downstream at Saudi Aramco, said in a statement on Wednesday that the joint venture formed in 1998 served the partners’ downstream business objectives “very well for many years.” “It is now time for the partners to pursue their independent downstream goals,” he said. A U.S. spokesman for The Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell said the breakup and split of Motiva’s assets were consistent with Shell’s plans to simplify its global portfolio. Motiva’s three refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have a combined capacity of over 1.1 million barrels per day, located within a 120-mile (195-km) radius of one another. The marketing operations support a network of about 8,300 Shell-branded gasoline stations in the Eastern and Southern United States. The partners said that under the terms of a non-binding letter of intent, Aramco would take over the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and retain 26 distribution terminals as well as the Motiva name. It will also have an exclusive license to use the Shell brand for gasoline and diesel sales in Texas, the majority of the Mississippi Valley, the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, it said. Shell will solely own the Louisiana refineries in Convent and Norco, where it also operates a chemicals plant, as well as Shell-branded gasoline stations in Florida, Louisiana and the Northeastern region. A Shell spokesman said the company would move forward with Motiva’s plan to integrate the Louisiana refineries to operate as a single 500,000-bpd plant. While sources close to the situation say the relationship between Shell and Aramco has been troubled, that tension grew after an ambitious $10 billion expansion of Motiva's flagship Port Arthur refinery. The project doubled its size to 603,000 barrels a day and surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N Baytown, Texas, plant as the country's largest. A disastrous leak of caustic fluid in a new unit crippled the plant shortly after top executives from Shell and Aramco unveiled the expansion in May 2012, upping the cost that already had ballooned from $5 billion. “That was a continuation of the bad blood,” said a person familiar with the relationship. In February 2014, Motiva hired Dan Romasko, who had been the top operations executive at refiner Tesoro Corp TSO.N, to replace former top Shell trading executive Bob Pease as chief executive. Romasko told Reuters in an interview a year ago that Motiva was “coming into its own” after the company announced plans to integrate the two Louisiana refineries. Sources familiar with the relationship also said Aramco was said to be angry at Shell when refinery workers at the three Motiva plants went on strike in early 2015. Shell led negotiations with the United Steelworkers union representing the workers, and the strike ended three weeks after the Motiva walkout."

With full context: * FTSEurofirst 300 falls 3 pct to 15 months lows * BHP Billiton takes $7.2 bln charge on U.S. assets * Oil and gas sector under pressure as crude drops below $30 * Syngenta up on M&A hopes, H&M boosted by strong December sales, By Danilo Masoni and Alistair Smout MILAN/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday to their lowest since December 2014, hit by losses in commodity-related stocks as BHP Billiton announced a major writedown and oil fell below $30 a barrel. Some investors said stocks were deeply oversold and flagged hopes of more central bank intervention to help reverse the trend after three straight week of losses. BHP Billiton shed 6.8 percent, the top faller on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, after saying it would write down the value of its U.S. shale assets by $7.2 billion. That cemented expectations the company will be forced to cut its dividend for the first time in more than 25 years. The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index was down 6 percent, with Rio Tinto, Glencore and Antofagasta also among top fallers. All four stocks also suffered from target price cuts by Japanese bank Nomura. Copper has hit a new 6-1/2 year low this week and was set for its second straight weekly loss. The oil and gas sector was also under pressure, down 3.7 percent. Brent and U.S. crude both fell below $30 a barrel, as markets braced for more oil supply from Iran. “Stocks are being driven by oil, and given that the Iranian sanctions are due to be lifted, that’s causing even more nervousness about this glut of oil that we have,” said Zeg Choudhry, managing director of LONTRAD. Concerns over commodities and Chinese growth have marked a rocky start to the year for global markets. Chinese shares closed at their lowest level since December 2014, rocked again by falling oil. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 3 percent at 1,294.69 points by 1514 GMT, set for its third straight weekly loss. It fell 6.7 percent last week when China allowed its currency to devalue and is down another 1.7 percent. Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy’s Consultinvest, said investors were testing central banks to see whether they had ammunition left to prop up markets and the economy. “There is a symbolic poker match between the market and central banks. I don’t think China and oil are the real problem here,” he said “The market is trying to force the hand of central banks in the hope they unleash more stimulus. So far there has been no answer but at some point it will arrive.” The European Central Bank holds its next policy meeting on Thursday. Among other fallers, Brenntag dropped 5.1 percent after the chemicals firm was cut to “hold” from “buy” by Deutsche Bank. The top riser was Syngenta, up 2.6 percent, following a Bloomberg report saying its board had voted in favour of pursuing advanced takeover talks with ChemChina. H&M was up 1 percent after it posted a rise in sales in December which beat forecasts. Today’s European research round-up (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni in Milan; Editing by Toby Chopra)"

With full context: * AB InBev proposes cash offer and partial share alternative * SABMiller says it “very substantially” undervalues it * African markets seen as key attraction to AB InBev * Top shareholder Altria supports offer, No. 2 does not (Adds comments by AB InBev CEO) By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - SABMiller, the world’s second largest brewer, has promptly rejected an improved takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev, saying its 68 billion-pound ($104 billion) valuation was “very substantially” under par. Refusal of the offer, made public on Wednesday after earlier proposals were refused privately, opens the door to a week of intense wrangling before an Oct. 14 deadline for a formal bid set by the UK takeover panel. The deal would be one of the biggest in corporate history, uniting the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois beers with that of Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell. The combined entity would make nearly a third of the world’s beer. AB InBev realistically needs access to SAB’s private financial data if it is to make an informed formal bid, but said that so far the board had not engaged meaningfully. A deadline extension can be granted if SABMiller asks for it, and AB InBev wants shareholders to lobby the company. “The deadline is approaching and we thought we should make it public,” AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on a conference call. “Now it’s up to the shareholders to have a look at it. If they think this is a good offer, they should act and encourage the board to engage.” Brito said he was committed to a friendly deal, but did not rule out going hostile. “I don’t want to go there now. I think there’s too much to be gained in the next few days,” he said. Belgium-based AB InBev went public with its offer of 42.15 pounds in cash per SABMiller share, after the board rejected two prior approaches, at 38 and 40 pounds. The offer includes a discounted cash-and-share alternative designed only for SAB’s two largest shareholders, Altria Group and BevCo. The discount aims to satisfy their desire to avoid huge taxes on cash gains and ensure all other shareholders accept cash, which would be financed with the help of a $70 billion debt package being lined up. Altria, the tobacco group which has 26.6 percent of SABMiller, said it supported the bid and would be prepared to opt for the share alternative. AB InBev said it lacked the support of BevCo, controlled by the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Representatives for BevCo, which owns about 13 percent of SABMiller, could not be reached by Reuters. BevCo has two seats on the SABMiller board. SABMiller said its board, excluding the three members nominated by Altria, unanimously rejected the proposal. “It still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects,” the UK-based company said in a statement. SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis called his company “the crown jewel of the global brewing industry” and said AB InBev’s proposals were designed to be unattractive to many shareholders. Lawyers not involved in the deal interpreted SAB’s language as implying that it could want as much as 10 percent more than the proposed price, which amounts to a 44 percent premium to SAB’s share price before news of AB InBev’s approach was made public on Sept. 16. AB InBev’s CEO called the price “full” and said SAB’s board was “over-optimistic” about its standalone prospects, saying the company would need an almost 50 percent jump in operating earnings in U.S. dollars to make up the value he is offering and that that would likely not happen for at least three or four years. The cash-and-share alternative, which is technically open to all shareholders, would give them 2.37 pounds per share plus 0.48 special unlisted AB InBev shares that are convertible into ordinary stock after a five-year lock-up period. Given that AB InBev intends to use this instrument to acquire the stakes of Altria and BevCo, which together own about 41 percent of the company, SABMiller said the implied price tag was only 40.21 pounds per share, or 65 billion pounds ($99.53 billion). RBC Capital Markets analysts said the proposal appeared some way below a “knock-out” bid, and Bernstein Securities said a higher bid, and acceptance, was the most likely outcome. SABMiller shares closed up 0.3 percent at 37.24 pounds, while AB InBev closed up 0.6 percent in Brussels at 98.65 euros. Analysts have long seen this deal as the likely end-game for decades of industry consolidation, as the big four - AB InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg already brew over half the world’s beer. It would add Africa and certain Latin American and Asian breweries to AB InBev’s presence across the Americas. “We believe Africa in particular will be a key driver for the joint company in the future,” Brito said. AB InBev also said it planned to establish a secondary share listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg, where SABMiller has a secondary listing, which local investors have said they want retained. Public Investment Corp, a South African state-owned firm with a 3.4 percent stake in SABMiller, said the listing addressed one of its concerns and that it would wait for guidance from SABMiller’s board. AB InBev, partly controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, has a strong track record for takeovers, followed by keen cost-cutting, but Brito declined to say what potential synergies a SABMiller deal might realise.

New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia,['boss faces stiff challenge'],Credit Suisse,-0.181,['Corporate/Risks'],headline,2,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0WD28920150312,"New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia. With full context: * CS could cut 3000 jobs from investment bank -analysts * Push into Asia private wealth faces challenge from incumbent UBS * CS also lags Swiss rival in investment banking in Asia (Rewrites throughout, adds details on CS performance in Asia) HONG KONG/LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Incoming Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam is expected to focus on private banking in Asia while aggressively cutting jobs at its investment bank, as he aims to repeat the success in the region of his old employer, Prudential. Thiam could slash 3,000 jobs from Credit Suisse’s investment bank, or 15 percent of staff globally, and cut 150 billion Swiss francs ($149 billion) of assets from the bank’s fixed income, commodities and currencies business as part of that shift, analysts at JPMorgan said. That may include Asia, where the former insurance executive will find a fiercely competitive landscape, dominated by cross-town rival UBS in the wealth management space and increasingly crowded with aggessive local players in investment banking. “Prudential’s markets in Asia have been green-field, high-growth and not over-competitive,” said Keith Pogson, senior partner for Asia-Pacific financial services at consulting firm EY. “But in the banking system low-cost local players are becoming stronger and stronger competitors. It’s a very different landscape.” Thiam takes over after current CEO Brady Dougan leaves in June. UBS - which shifted its focus to the region earlier - has nearly twice the assets under managements in Asia, though Credit Suisse is starting to make significant strides there. Last year, Asia Pacific accounted for 63 percent of all net new wealth Credit Suisse attracted, bringing total wealth management assets managed in the region to 143.5 billion Swiss francs, confirming Asia as a main driver of growth. By contrast, UBS’s wealth management division had 269 billion Swiss francs of invested assets in the region at the end of 2014. “Asia as a subsegment, it’s been a very important area of growth for Credit Suisse. Even though margins tend to be lower, from a growth point of view, it’s still highly attractive,” said Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura in London. Credit Suisse’s investment banking division in Asia Pacific, is also lagging UBS, according to Thomson Reuters data. In advisory rankings Credit Suisse has fallen every year since 2010, from 4th place then to 15th last year and 17th in the year to date. In equity capital markets rankings, where Swiss rival UBS has consistently been the top-ranked player in Asia since 2010, Credit Suisse ranked 6th in 2014 and 4th in 2013, the data show. And in debt underwriting, Credit Suisse again ranked outside the top 10 advisors every year since 2010. Thiam, who contrary to Dougan has no experience of investment banking, may be sufficiently detached from the business to make some tough choices, bankers say. “Asia has been a fairly difficult area for European investment banks to make money. The investment bank is the main question over the new CEO strategy,” said Simon Adamson, European banking analyst at CreditSights. “If they do decide to scale back, that would also include their Asia business.”"

With full context: * Sees higher full-year transformation costs * Expects UK parcels, postal market to remain tough * Shares fall as much as 5.8 pct (Adds comments by CEO, further details, updates share price) May 19 (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail Plc warned on Thursday it faced slightly higher than previously expected costs to modernise its operations in what it said was an extremely competitive domestic postal and parcel market. Royal Mail’s prospects hinge on its ability to cut costs and modernise operations to gain a larger share of the parcels market in light of declining letter volumes. “It’s an intensely competitive time in the UK and I don’t see that letting up anytime soon and I see the trends in that regards to be broadly the same this year as they were last year,” Chief Executive Moya Greene told Reuters. It has also been hurt by the loss of some business from key customer Amazon, which recently started its own delivery network. Other competitors such as UK Mail have added extra capacity, threatening Royal Mail’s dominance at home. The 500-year-old company, whose red post boxes decorated with the Royal Crest are a feature of landscapes across the UK, forecast costs associated with the transformation of its UK business of around 160 million pounds ($233 million) for the current financial year. It previously forecast 120 million pounds to 140 million pounds per year until 2018. Its shares fell as much as 5.8 percent and were down 3.8 percent at 488.8 pence by 1040 GMT, underperforming London’s blue chip FTSE 100 index. Its shares have gained around 14 percent since the beginning of the year. Analysts also pointed to uncertainties over the outcome of a review of the company by regulator Ofcom, which is looking into whether Royal Mail breached competition law, and negotiation talks over wages and its pension scheme. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo wrote the higher costs could drag down Royal Mail’s results for the year ending March 2017. Helped by tight cost control, Royal Mail’s adjusted operating profit before transformational costs rose 5 percent to 742 million in the year ended March 27. Analysts on average had expected 727 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus. Including pensions accounting and other one-off items, however, profit fell 2 percent.

With full context: * FTSE 100 closes down 1.3 pct * Johnson Matthey drops despite increased profits * Royal Mail hit by government share sale news * UBS cuts its full-year target for the index * Airline easyJet bucks trend after traffic update (Updates price moves) By Liisa Tuhkanen and Alistair Smout LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index fell on Thursday, led lower by specialty chemicals maker Johnson Matthey and ex-dividend stocks in a broad sell-off in equities. Johnson Matthey, the world’s largest maker of auto catalysts, shed 5.3 percent, making it the top FTSE 100 faller. The company posted a small rise in annual profit helped by higher sales of catalysts in Europe, but investors worried about an unexpectedly sharp increase in debt caused by a rise in working capital and weaker precious metals prices, which have hit its metals division in the last year. “Rising car sales in Europe and tighter regulation on fuel discharges drove profits higher, but the dreary outlook for the metal business has put pressure on the stock,” David Madden, a market analyst at IG, said in a note. Royal Mail fell 4.9 percent after Finance Minister George Osborne said Britain will sell its 30 percent stake in the postal operator. Britain’s FTSE 100 closed down 1.3 percent at 6,859.24. “If we look across developed markets, sell-off in equities is pretty broad. To me, it’s probably more to do with monetary policy than anything else,” said James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts. The European Central Bank’s insistence on Wednesday that there was no need to adjust monetary policy in the face of volatility rattled financial markets. <GVD/EUR FRX/> The sell-off on the FTSE was broad-based, with all sectors in negative territory. Many of the top fallers traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts, with National Grid and WPP dropping 5.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively. Commodity stocks were also weaker, with gold pinned near a three-year low and further downside to metal prices seen. UBS trimmed its full year target for the FTSE 100 to 7,200 points from 7,300, citing weak commodity stocks, even as it raised its target price for the STOXX Europe 600. “We see FTSE 100 earnings falling 8 percent this year (in the main, due to the fall in commodity prices), but rebounding 10 percent in 2016,” analysts at UBS said in a note. Among the few gainers, budget airline easyJet rose 0.6 percent after reporting traffic figures that traders said were solid. “Shares in easyJet are outperforming blue-chip rivals after monthly traffic statistics pointed to monthly passenger growth... coupled with load factors up 1 to 2 percentage points to exceed 91 percent,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. “May’s passenger growth represents a bounce from a slower April ... back to the levels last seen in Feb/March.” (Editing by Tom Heneghan/Ruth Pitchford)"

Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus,['IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus'],IAG,0.12,['Corporate/M&A/M&A'],headline,0,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0UR13P20150112,"Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus. With full context: LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) can pay more than the 1.3 billion euros it is dangling before Irish rival Aer Lingus. The proposed price barely covers the value of the Dublin-based airline’s fleet, its slots at London Heathrow airport and its net cash. IAG cannot expect to get a decent operating business thrown in for free. On one view, the improved proposal of 2.4 euros per share - 10 cents more than IAG’s first proposal in mid-December - appears good enough. It’s a 32 percent markup on the target’s share price on the day before the possibility of a bid became public, and an even higher premium to the average share price over the three months before. But Aer Lingus’ recent market value is not the best benchmark for assessing the take-out price. It is affected by a dispute between main shareholder Ryanair and regulators who want the low-cost carrier to reduce its 29.9 percent stake to below 5 percent. The uncertainty over the when and how of Ryanair’s potential exit weighed on Aer Lingus’ stock. Moreover, the Irish government’s 25.1 percent stake means the free-float is thin and trading illiquid. A higher premium can be justified on fundamentals. Aer Lingus’ fleet of Airbus aircraft have a book value of 660 million euros. The carrier holds 23 daily starting and landing rights at London Heathrow, British Airway’s main hub, which have an estimated market value of 250 million pounds (320 million euros), based on Breakingviews calculations. Factor in about 400 million euros of net cash, and the carrier’s inherent value stands at about 1.4 billion euros. Its profitable and growing operations deserve a further markup. The Dublin-based airline boasts strong growth in transatlantic flights, has a lean cost base and eked out an average operating margin of 3.9 percent over the last decade. HSBC analysts expect the margin to rise to 6.8 percent by 2015. For IAG, the deal is a good strategic fit and a hedge against further delays of Heathrow expansion. Aer Lingus’ board is showing some welcome resolve in rejecting the proposals so far. It can hold out for something between 2.5 euros and three euros a share. - International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, said on Jan. 9 that Aer Lingus had rejected a revised all-cash takeover proposal that valued the Irish airline at 2.4 euros per share or 1.3 billion euros. - “There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming,” IAG said. - IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, made a 2.3 euros-a-share proposal in December. - Aer Lingus shares fell about 5 percent to 2.37 euros in early European trading on Jan. 12. - Reuters: Aer Lingus rejects revised approach from BA owner Flying home - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on (Editing by Chris Hughes and Sarah Bailey)"

With full context: LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi has poached one of AstraZeneca’s top scientists to be its new research head in another high-profile departure for the British drugmaker. Sanofi said on Tuesday that Yong-Jun Liu had been appointed as head of research with effect from April 1, reporting to Elias Zerhouni, the group’s president of global research and development. Liu, a specialist in immunology with more than 250 published articles in leading academic journals, currently heads up research at AstraZeneca’s MedImmune biotechnology division, a position he has held since 2014. Prior to that he led programmes at Baylor Research Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he was founding director of the Cancer Immunology Research Institute. His decision to leave AstraZeneca follows the exit last June of Briggs Morrison, the company’s former chief medical officer and head of late-stage drug development, and respiratory and inflammatory medicines head James Ward-Lilley. AstraZeneca is going through a transition as older drugs lose patent protection and it invests heavily in new medicines, especially in the field of cancer immunotherapy. It has a promising pipeline of experimental drugs but has also suffered some recent setbacks, including last week’s failure of its marketed heart drug Brilinta as a treatment for stroke patients and earlier disappointing results with a drug to treat lung and abdominal cancer mesothelioma. Sanofi, meanwhile, is seeking to rejuvenate its early-stage pipeline and Zerhouni said Liu’s experience in immunology, oncology and translational medicine would be “vital assets” for this task.

With full context: * Glencore to cut 500,000 tonnes of annual zinc production * Global zinc market to swing into deficit -analyst * Markets relieved that Fed seen holding off raising rates (Updates with closing prices) LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Zinc surged 12 percent to a two-month peak on Friday and other base metals also rose strongly after commodities group Glencore said it would cut its zinc output by a third, sparking a short-covering rally across the board. Zinc’s jump, its biggest one-day gain in at least a decade, followed Glencore’s announcement that it will cut 500,000 tonnes of annual zinc production, equivalent to around 4 percent of global supply, in its latest response to weak commodities prices. The miner has already pledged copper and coal production cuts in response to prices at multi-year lows. The rally is a shot in the arm for the beleaguered metals industry, many of whose members are heading to London for the annual LME Week celebrations which start on Monday. “This (Glencore move) is big, it’s much bigger than the move in copper, it shifts the needle substantially. The rally is not going to all peter out, though having said that the jump today is in large part because of short covering,” BNP Paribas strategist Stephen Briggs said. Zinc mine supply had already been set to shrink given the closure of MMG’s huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland this year. “The cut is certainly significant and swings the zinc market into a deficit for 2016, which we estimate will now be around 300,000 tonnes, a reversal of the 180,000 tonne surplus we were forecasting earlier,” analyst Edward Meir at INTL FCSTone said in a note. London Metal Exchange three-month zinc shot up to an intraday peak of $1,875 a tonne, a gain of 12.5 percent. That was its highest price since Aug. 11 and its biggest single-day gain in Reuters data, which goes back to mid-2005. It closed up 10.1 percent at $1,835. Zinc prices sank to their lowest in over five years at$1,601.50 late last month, partly on an overhang of inventories. Also supporting metals was a weaker dollar index, which fell on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates, making commodities cheaper for buyers outside of the United States. Lead, which is often mined alongside zinc, surged nearly 9 percent at one point to $1,821.50 a tonne, its highest since late July, before paring gains to close at $1,780, up 6.4 percent. Copper climbed 3 percent to finish at $5,290 a tonne while aluminium gained 3.3 percent to end at $1,613. Nickel raced 6 percent higher to a two-month peak of $10,785 a tonne before retreating. It failed to trade in closing open outcry activity and was bid at $10,500, up 3.2 percent. Tin added 1.6 percent to close at $16,150. For metals, concerns persist about the growth slowdown in China, which consumes about half the world’s copper. Senior metals executives in China expect most base metals will face tepid demand there next year.

With full context: (Recasts, updates with details from Takeda review) WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc’s diabetes drug Onglyza and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s rival product Nesina should carry information about the risk of heart failure, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, according to the Mayo Clinic. The panel reviewed safety data on AstraZeneca’s Onglyza and Takeda’s Nesina. The drugs belong to a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors which also includes Merck & Co.’s Januvia. Januvia data from a trial known as TECOS will be presented at a scientific meeting in June. The studies were requested by the FDA as part of a broader investigation into the safety of diabetes drugs. In December 2008, the agency issued guidance requiring companies to conduct studies to show the drugs did not increase cardiovascular risk. The panel found that neither Onglyza nor Nesina increased the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack. But data showed a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure with Onglyza and an increased risk with Nesina that did not reach statistical significance. Some panelists said that even though the heart failure risk seen with Nesina was modest, they suspect the risk will turn out to be a DPP-4 class effect and therefore worth including. The panel did not recommend any restrictions on prescribing the drugs. AstraZeneca’s U.S. shares rose 3.2 percent. Takeda’s shares closed down 0.67 percent before the vote was announced. Merck’s shares rose 1.8 percent. “Given the absence of a serious safety issue for either Onglyza or Takeda’s Nesina suggests that, barring an overtly negative signal in TECOS, growth of the DPP-4 class is likely to continue without a meaningful change in current prescribing trends,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. A preliminary FDA review of Onglyza published on Friday found an increase in the rate of death from all causes. Panel members said they were moderately concerned about the signal but said their concern was muted by the fact that the causes of death were varied and lacked any common theme. Onglyza, known also as saxagliptin, was approved in 2009. Nesina, or alogliptin, was approved in 2013. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so."

With full context: * Optimistic about outlook for key commodities * Glasenberg says rivals should understand supply and demand * Optimum mine closure would lead to expansion elsewhere (Adds details on coal asset planned shutdown) LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The head of global mining and trading company Glencore said rivals were to blame for an oversupply of metals which depressed its share price. Despite a partial recovery in the last few months, Glencore’s shares are down about 6 percent from a year ago, under pressure from a rout in prices for most of the commodities it produces and trades. “Unfortunately our competitors in the world have produced more supply than demand and commodity prices are down for that reason,” Glasenberg said at the company’s annual meeting. “I am doing my level best to convince my competitors we should understand the words demand and supply,” he added in response to a question from an investor about the share price. Glasenberg has criticised rivals such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton at various times, blaming them for oversupplying the market, particularly in iron ore, a commodity Glencore has little exposure to. Glasenberg said he was optimistic about the outlook for its key products: copper, nickel and zinc. Coal, another main commodity for Glencore, also “looks good going forward”, Glasenberg said, as Indonesia exports taper off with the country consuming more coal domestically. Coal prices have been battered by a large supply overhang in the last couple of years. Glasenberg has said unlike his rivals he would not aim to “cannibalise” his own market by adding to the glut. The world’s largest exporter of thermal coal said in March that its 2015 coal output was expected to fall by around 6 percent on the year after production cuts at some of its coal operations. But London-listed Glencore’s coal output rose by 4 percent in the first quarter this year from the same period a year ago. In January the company said it could shut down production destined for export from its Optimum Coal Mines in South Africa, which would put 1,070 jobs at risk. In reply to a shareholder who asked the company to prevent such a blow to the country, South Africa-born Glasenberg said if the company goes ahead with the Optimum closure it would expand capacity at another lower cost South African mine. “So the net net effect should be the same but (would) just provide more benefit for shareholders, more benefit for the country, larger taxes being paid,” he said.

Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs,['Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs'],Shire,0.235,['Corporate/M&A/M&A'],headline,0,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0KK0QE20150111,"Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs. With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - Shire Plc has agreed to buy NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion in its biggest acquisition yet, as the Dublin-based drugmaker strengthens its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases. The takeover continues the breakneck pace of deal-making in 2014 in the pharmaceuticals sector, as companies jockey for promising assets amid a wave of new drugs emerging from research laboratories. Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told Reuters he would keep looking for more deals to grow the company into a biotech powerhouse. Shire will pay $46.00 per NPS share, representing a premium of nearly 10 percent to NPS’ Friday close, the two companies said on Sunday. The move will not come as a huge surprise, since Shire was first linked to NPS in May 2014. When plans for Shire to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart in October, Shire said it could look again at earlier deal prospects and reports of Shire’s interest resurfaced in mid-December. “This is about growth and rare diseases, and it fits hand in glove with our strategy and our franchise,” Ornskov said. Shire expects the all-cash deal to add to its adjusted earnings from 2016 onward. It believes it can achieve cost savings of approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of consensus forecasts for NPS’ standalone future operating cost base from 2017. The acquisition of New Jersey-based NPS will give Shire two significant new drugs. Gattex, a treatment for short-bowel syndrome, is already on the market, while Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is slated to decide on the Natpara application by Jan. 24. “I am confident that Natpara will be approved on the 24th, however ... there is absolutely no guarantee,” said NPS CEO Francois Nader. “Given our interactions with the FDA, I believe it will be approved.” Nader called Shire’s decision to conclude a deal before a decision “a calculated risk on their part,” that nevertheless “would provide the joint company the opportunity to deploy the most resources in supporting the launch.” Consensus analyst forecasts for the two NPS medicines point to annual sales of $509 million and $534 million respectively by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, although Ornskov believes they may bring in more. “Both of them have significant sales potential and some have mentioned the word ‘blockbuster’,” he said. The term blockbuster applies to a drug with sales of $1 billion or more. “ALWAYS CONSIDERING NEXT DEAL” Shire, which will tender NPS shares, has secured an $850 million bank loan which, together with cash reserves and an existing $2.1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, will pay for the deal. Even though NPS is a record acquisition for Shire, Ornskov expects the deal, which could close in the first quarter of this year, to be paid off quickly. “We are incredibly cash-generative and this will add to that, so this does not prevent us from considering further deals,” he said. “Shire is always considering the next deal.” Shire’s coffers were boosted to the tune of more than $1.6 billion when it got a windfall break-up fee after AbbVie walked away from its $55 billion takeover bid. Citigroup and Lazard acted as joint financial advisers to Shire, with Goldman Sachs and Leerink advising NPS."

With full context: LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain’s Barclays Plc has named JPmorgan Chase & Co executive Paul Compton its new Chief Operating Officer, following the departure of Jonathan Moulds. Compton, who will join in May, will oversee operations & technology, structural reform, cost transformation and major project delivery, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. Compton’s appointment comes at a time when Barclays has been reviewing global operations, and closely follows the appointment of another JPMorgan veteran, Jes Staley, as chief executive in December. Barclays said in an internal memo to staff in January that it planned to cut about 1,000 jobs in investment banking worldwide and close its cash equities business in Asia. Moulds will leave the bank to pursue other opportunities, Barclays said in its statement. (Reporting by Richa Naidu and Sinead Cruise; Editing by Rachel Armstrong)"

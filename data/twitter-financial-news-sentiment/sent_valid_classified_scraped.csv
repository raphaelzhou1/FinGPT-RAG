With full context: A man hangs decorations next to a banner showing Pakistan’s President Mamnoon Hussain (L), Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, before Xi’s visit to Islamabad April 19, 2015. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood Pakistan is awash with a tidal wave of Chinese infrastructure projects. The small town of Gwadar, for example, was a forgotten end of the earth, filled with dust-colored cinder-block houses that lined trash-strewn streets and ringed by cliffs, desert and the Arabian Sea. Yet this sleepy fishing town has erupted with development over the past few years. A Chinese delegation inaugurated its sparkling new container port in early April, as part of a deal by which China will build and have rights over the port. China has agreed to spend an extraordinary $46 billion in investment throughout Pakistan, far more than the annual U.S. aid budget for the entire world. This is now Beijing’s biggest commitment to any one country. Pakistan is also the largest recipient of Chinese weapons, and Beijing increasingly relies on it to help contain militants in China’s western provinces. Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) meets with Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain (3rd R) at The Great Hall Of The People in Beijing, China, September 2, 2015. REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool Pakistan holds a unique position in Chinese diplomatic circles. The Chinese state media describes Pakistan as China’s only “all-weather strategic cooperation partner.” Though it is the largest beneficiary of Beijing’s investment, it is not a client state, as North Korea is. Rather, in a neighborhood where many countries either distrust China, feel beholden to it or both, Pakistan is the closest thing to a real ally and friend that Beijing possesses. This means that China and Pakistan sometimes cooperate in ways that concern the United States and India. Washington and New Delhi worry that all this largesse will bring Pakistan firmly into China’s orbit. With subtle diplomacy, however, all four countries may be able to create a workable balance. The Gwadar port is just one example of China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative. This effort is by far the most spectacular example of Beijing’s strategic policy of combining aid, trade and foreign direct investment to build goodwill, expand its global political sway and secure the natural resources it needs to grow. Declaring that the Chinese-Pakistani friendship is “sweeter than honey,” and “stronger than steel,” Beijing announced last year that it would finance a 1,800-mile-long superhighway and a high-speed railway from the Arabian Sea over the Himalayas to China’s Xinjiang province. In addition, it would fund an oil pipeline route to the inland Chinese city of Kashgar. This network of infrastructure, including the Gwadar port, would help Pakistan grow, while pushing back against the growing power of regional competitors like India. Helping Pakistan so dramatically also fits into China’s overall economic strategy. With a deep-sea port in the Arabian Sea and a land route to remote western China, some of Beijing’s Middle Eastern oil could travel the short route through Pakistan, instead of 6,000 miles through the Malacca Straits to Shanghai. That’s the route more than 80 percent of China’s oil and natural resources now have to take. A China’s People’s Liberation Army trooper (L) and Pakistani soldier salute their countries’ flags at the start of joint military exercises in Abbotabad, 85 km (53 miles) northwest of Islamabad, December 11, 2006. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood The infrastructure projects allow China to invest its large, if dwindling, foreign currency reserves, and also buy goodwill with its neighbors. Chinese state-owned companies get additional work, and the many energy projects that are part of the deal offer strong financial returns. The initiative even has the convenient side effect of annoying India, Pakistan’s archenemy and China’s potential strategic rival. Chinese engineers have already begun digging tunnels and building bridges to improve safety along the legendary Karakoram highway, one of the highest paved roads on earth, which links Pakistan to China. In addition, China is Pakistan’s largest trading partner and allows Pakistan special trade preferences through a free-trade agreement signed in 2006, though the volume of trade with Pakistan remains a drop in the bucket for Beijing. As another sign of the growing alliance, Pakistan and China are close partners militarily, and their cooperation has increased in recent years. Pakistan accounts for more than a third of Chinese weapons sales. In just the past seven months, Pakistan and China have conducted joint military exercises in Pakistan, China and, for the first time, in the East China Sea. China also built six nuclear reactors in Pakistan over the past two decades and expects to help build at least two more. This is raising concerns with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an institution that supervises the export of global civilian nuclear technology. In the 1980s and 1990s, China helped develop Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program. Some intelligence suggests that Beijing even helped with Pakistan’s new frightening miniature “battlefield” nuclear weapons, and with its first weaponized drone. Many in India and the United States are alarmed about what they see as a China-Pakistan axis. They worry that China’s largesse means that Western nations will have little leverage to shape Pakistan’s actions on militants or nuclear weapons, or in supporting peace in Afghanistan. Another concern is that China would protect Pakistan when, for example, it refuses to cooperate with India and the West on handing over dangerous militants Delegations from Afghanistan, Pakistan, United States and China at a meeting in Kabul, Afghanistan, February 23, 2016. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani Washington should indeed monitor the China-Pakistan relationship closely, but the signs are not all bad. There is still much the world can do to prevent South Asia from splitting into two hostile China-Pakistan and India-U.S. camps, which is in no one’s interest. The West should cautiously welcome China’s lavish economic investment in Pakistan because more development helps stabilize the country, a positive result for everyone. Although China considers Pakistan an ally and a convenient access route to western China, China has broader interests in the region that may cause it to moderate Pakistan’s more worrisome tendencies. China trades more with India than with Pakistan and shares with it a long, sometimes contested border. So despite sometimes touchy relations, China cannot afford to really antagonize New Delhi. More broadly, addressing Islamic militancy is a serious goal for Beijing because small groups of Uighur militants have launched violent attacks in China and at times allied   with the Pakistani Taliban, Islamic State and others. This alliance means that China is likely prodding Pakistan to do more to crack down on militants there. It could also have a positive effect for Afghanistan, where China has become engaged in pushing for peace talks, and just announced a small security aid package. The United States, India and others should keep in mind that — weak as it is — Pakistan is one of China’s only real partners. They should engage both Chinese and Pakistani officials on economic development in the region, as well as terrorism and Afghanistan’s future. They should make clear, again and again, that Washington wants good relations with all states in the area. As long as India and the United States have a seat at the table, all four may be able to work out a satisfactory balance. In this complex dance, there are no simple solutions. "

China central bank warns high financial risks amid rising economic headwinds - Reuters https://t.co/p26nFHoGg5,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XZ151,"China central bank warns high financial risks amid rising economic headwinds Reuters. With full context: BEIJING (Reuters) - China needs to resolve outstanding financial risks, and must counter risks from “abnormal” market fluctuations that stem from external shocks, said the central bank on Monday, as Beijing prioritizes financial stability amid increasing challenges. Financial markets are highly sensitive to global trade situations and rising uncertainties in global liquidity, said the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in its annual financial stability report, adding that it will step up real-time supervision on stock, bond, foreign exchange markets to prevent cross-sector risk contamination. Bond defaults may continue, so authorities must prevent the risks of such defaults from triggering systemic risks, it said, while penalties on regulatory violations in the securities market would be increased. Beijing has stepped up daily supervisions and assessment on potential “black swan” and “gray rhino” events that may occur in the future and has prepared contingency plans, as downward pressure on the economy rises, said the PBOC. China’s household leverage ratio rose to 60.4% relative to gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2018, reaching the international average level and posing debt risks in some regions and low income families, according to the annual report. The central bank reiterated that it would maintain a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy, as well as implement greater tax cuts and increase the issuance quota for local governments’ special bonds used to fund infrastructure projects by a large margin. Looking ahead, the PBOC will tailor its credit supply to better boost the economy and strike a fine balance in achieving growth and fending off risks. “Overall speaking, China’s financial risks have been slowly resolved but the risks are still abundant, after accumulating rapidly in the past few years,” said the PBOC. It added that potential risks and problems will be difficult to eliminate in the short term. At the end of last year, 13.5% of China’s 4,379 financial institutions, mostly rural and smaller institutions, were rated as “high-risk” by the PBOC in the annual review of the industry. That compared with an about 10.58% of institutions that failed the PBOC’s 2018 test. It is also exploring development of an exit mechanism for unqualified shareholders of rural financial institutions, as well as market-based and diversified approaches for financial institutions to exit the market. Earlier this year, a rare government seizure of then little-known Baoshang Bank and the state rescue of Jinzhou Bank 0416.HK and Hengfeng Bank revived concerns about the true health of hundreds of small lenders in the country as China's economic growth slowed to nearly a 30-year low. China's big four banks - Bank of China 601988.SS, Agricultural Bank of China 601288.SS, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 601398.SS and China Construction Bank 601939.SS - face relatively large pressures to meet standards for their total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), said the PBOC. It will coordinate with other departments to roll out regulations to help those banks meet TLAC requirements on time, it added."

Fed's Mester says central bank can watch and wait on interest rates,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N31417E,"Fed's Mester says central bank can watch and wait on interest rates. With full context: [1/3]A person walks past a stall selling fruit and vegetables in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 28, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Faced with mounting evidence that loose U.S. monetary policy contributed to the breakout of inflation last year, the Federal Reserve now faces the risk it jumped too far the other way with its plans to fight price pressures through continued aggressive interest rate hikes even as the world economy wobbles. The warning signs of a policy overcorrection have intensified as the U.S. central bank's intent to ""raise and hold"" its benchmark overnight interest rate touched off a global asset repricing - stocks and currencies have fallen and borrowing costs for governments and corporations have risen - that some analysts worry has outpaced the Fed's ability to assess the impact of its policies. Broad measures of financial conditions have tightened fast in U.S. markets. Economists at Morgan Stanley recently estimated that between inflation and stricter Fed policy, dollar liquidity in the United States, Europe, Japan and China has declined by $4 trillion since March and is falling fast. The current path ""will lead to intolerable economic and financial stress,"" Michael Wilson, an equity analyst at the investment bank, wrote on Sunday. ""The first question to ask is, when does the U.S. dollar become a U.S. problem"" through global and market impacts that start to influence the American economy and lead Fed officials to reevaluate the pace of their monetary tightening. The Fed raised interest rates at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third time in a row, and indicated further large increases were in the offing later this year. So far, U.S. central bank officials insist nothing in the global marketplace has changed the game plan, even as analysts parse every adverb in policymakers' public remarks for signs that a lighter-touch Fed may emerge at next month's meeting. This reading of the tea leaves was on display last week when some investors interpreted Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard's reference to ""deliberately"" raising interest rates as a signal the central bank might slow down the pace of tightening. The shift in monetary policy this year has been the most dramatic in decades, with the Fed's policy rate rising a full 3 percentage points to the current 3.00%-3.25% range. While Fed projections released last month showed officials at the median penciling in another large rate hike at the Nov. 1-2 meeting, the group was closely divided. In interviews and public statements over the past week, however, Fed policymakers, far from concern over rattled asset markets, have laid out detailed accounts of what they got wrong on inflation over the past two years - including mistakes in their own policymaking - and their intent to fix it. ""Inflation is turning out to be much more persistent than we thought it was going to be,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on the sidelines of a conference at the regional bank. The list of culprits is long and includes things, like unexpected changes in people's choices over what to buy and where to work and the surprising inflexibility of U.S. supply chains, over which the Fed has little influence. But while those developments might have caused relative shifts in prices, Mester and others at the Fed now believe it was the joint evolution of monetary and fiscal policy over the last two years that created the more persistent increase in the underlying price level that the Fed is now trying to arrest. Pandemic-era fiscal policy was meant to create a ""bridge"" to help households and businesses through the COVID-19 crisis. But the more than $5 trillion in payments, loans and other aid, with new stimulus still being rolled out as late as the spring of 2021, built a world-class surge of cash that fueled purchases of goods and services that the economy strained to provide. Fed policy, oriented to fight the pandemic and ensure U.S. workers found a pathway back to jobs, remained loose throughout, with low interest rates that were meant to encourage spending in effect until only recently. Underlying, or ""core"" inflation, became embedded ""because we actually needed to raise our funds rate, or fiscal policy had to adjust to be less accommodative,"" Mester said last week. In the moment ""there was a feeling that policy wasn't too accommodative, because it was a huge pandemic shock ... One thing we learned is the economy is actually much more resilient than people thought it was going to be."" Acting otherwise would have been difficult. In March 2021, for example, when President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was enacted and the last rounds of stimulus checks were being written, the unemployment rate was still 6%, the rollout of coronavirus vaccines was at an early stage, and inflation was only beginning to percolate. By the Fed's preferred measure, inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.7% in February 2021, below the central bank's 2% target. Though it spiked in March to 2.5% and kept climbing, shifting policy at that point would have put the Fed in direct conflict with fiscal authorities who were still fighting to blunt the economic fallout of the pandemic - an uncomfortable position akin to what Bank of England officials are facing after the government of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced major tax cuts. That would have been an exceptional bit of foresight, taken in an era when uncertainty has ruled and just as Biden's presidency was taking shape. ""How could you not say we called it wrong. I don't run away from that,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in comments to reporters last week in Virginia. ""The implicit perspective was this was going to be a demand recovery problem. So you got to do everything you can to demand"" with policies to boost consumption and income. In hindsight, ""how much did we have to actually have to do?"" 'MOVED THE NEEDLE' The Fed now faces a version of the same problem: How long to wait for evidence that inflation, now running at more than three times the central bank's target, is falling before adjusting the pace of rate increases or even the endpoint of the policy rate. Those concerned about the torrid and insistent pace of Fed rate increases argue that inflation is on the verge of turning, and that continued aggressive rate hikes could push the economy towards higher-than-necessary unemployment - the jobless rate is currently 3.7% - and slower-than-necessary growth. ""They have moved the needle ... I am not sure they need to be as aggressive as they think they need to be,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics and an advocate of the view that much recent inflation can be traced to rising profit margins that he thinks will quickly reverse as demand wanes. If that proves true, and oil prices don't spike again, a closely watched Fed gauge of inflation could be collapsing next year, Shepherdson estimates. That's an argument Brainard also mentioned in a recent paper, suggesting that falling profit margins could ""make an important contribution to reduced pricing pressures."" But the timing is uncertain, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the ""clock is ticking"" on the central bank to show it can make progress on inflation in order to keep its credibility with markets and the American public. Even after listing the forces she thought could pull inflation down and mentioning the ""risks associated with overtightening,"" Brainard said the Fed remained singularly focused. ""We have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability,"" she said. ""We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down.""

Markets bet Fed is pushed to cut rates in coronavirus response https://t.co/4NDOpE6Kka https://t.co/8L2dYY8EYK,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2AO0MS,"Markets bet Fed is pushed to cut rates in coronavirus response. With full context: (Reuters) - Financial markets on Monday ratcheted up bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will be pressed to cut interest rates to cushion a feared hit to economic growth from the spread of the coronavirus, although one official cautioned against expecting the central bank to over-react to short-term market moves. U.S. interest rate futures surged to their highest levels since last fall as evidence the virus was spreading further outside its original epicenter of China spurred a global sell-off in stocks and panicked buying of government bonds. Wall Street recorded its biggest sell-off in two years. The federal funds futures contract tied to the Fed's July policy meeting FFN0 reflected a roughly 85% probability the central bank's benchmark overnight lending rate would be at least a quarter percentage point lower after that meeting's conclusion, according to the CME FedWatch tool. A month ago that was seen as a roughly 50-50 prospect. Contracts expiring in early 2021 FFF1FFG1 were priced for a Fed policy rate of around 1% or lower, compared with the current level of between 1.50% to 1.75%, where it sits after three rate cuts last year. Top U.S. central bank officials have signaled repeatedly that they see no need to cut rates further any time soon because they see the American economy performing well and it is too soon to judge the risk from coronavirus. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester was the latest to take note of the risk. In remarks to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington, she described the outbreak as a “big risk.” “At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring,” she said. But Mester pushed back against the notion that the Fed would be driven to act in response to jittery financial markets. “I just caution that you don’t want to over-react to volatility in the markets if you’re a monetary policymaker,” she said. Still, as the virus spreads, the resolve of Mester and other policymakers is likely to be tested in the weeks ahead. Monday’s stocks swoon followed a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. “The immediate risk is now about financial conditions,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “The real impact is small — but volatility, if the dollar rises, stocks fall, that is a direct hit.” In the U.S. Treasury market, the yield on the 30-year bond US30YT=RR - often viewed as a proxy for growth expectations - tumbled to record low of around 1.81%. Perhaps more tellingly for the Fed, the 2-year note's US2YT=RR yield slid to below 1.25%, the lowest in nearly three years, taking it further below the Fed's rate. As the shortest duration of so-called coupon debt - bonds with a maturity longer than a year - the 2-year note's yield reflects bond market investors' expectations for Fed policy. A month ago it was generally aligned with the fed funds rate. As concerns about the coronavirus have grown, however, the gap between the two has widened at roughly the pace seen last spring before the Fed’s run of three rate cuts between July and October. On Friday, a survey of U.S. purchasing managers indicated that activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors appeared to have stalled this month because of the outbreak, which upended global supply networks when goods production in China ground to a halt. Apart from that report from IHS Markit, little evidence has yet to emerge of the virus denting U.S. growth, although economists have begun predicting it will. Goldman Sachs on Sunday cut its estimate for first-quarter gross domestic product growth to 1.2% from 1.4% because of the disruption to supply chains. At NatWest Markets, analysts said they “agree that this Fed has a very dovish reaction function,” and thus would not be surprised by a Fed response before too long. But they question whether it will actually help much in the event the outbreak begins affecting U.S. businesses. “If a U.S. company (with a certain earnings stream priced in) can’t source inputs because overseas factories are idled with workers sick or locked down in their homes, a fed funds rate at 1.5% or at 0.25% is irrelevant,” they wrote in a note to clients on Monday."

With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s government opened the first part of a 330 billion pound ($384 billion) loan guarantee scheme for businesses on Monday, which will help small and medium-sized firms borrow up to 5 million pounds to deal with coronavirus stoppages. “Any viable business” with a turnover of up to 45 million pounds would be able to apply to banks for a 12-month interest-free loan, 80% of which will be guaranteed by the government, the finance ministry said. “We know that businesses are in urgent need of access to funding during these unprecedented times,” business minister Alok Sharma said. The finance ministry said further measures would be announced to ensure large and medium-sized businesses had access to the finance they needed. The Bank of England confirmed the opening too of a program to buy short-term debt known as commercial paper, issued by large businesses which had an investment-grade credit rating or similar financial strength before the coronavirus hit. Last week BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank would look at whether it could widen access to the scheme to firms with lower credit quality, or buy other financial instruments such as asset-backed commercial paper."

Africa retailer Jumia suspends e-commerce in Cameroon,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS1YK,"Africa retailer Jumia suspends e-commerce in Cameroon. With full context: JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Online retailer Jumia Technologies said on Monday it had suspended its e-commerce platform activities in Cameroon because they were “not suitable” for the African state. Dubbed “the Amazon of Africa”, the company founded in 2012 by two French former McKinsey consultants has grown quickly to become the continent’s leading e-commerce firm, operating in more than a dozen countries. Jumia, whose share price hit a record low of $4.96 after Reuters reported the suspension on Monday, said it would continue supporting buyers and vendors in Cameroon using its classified portal Jumia Deals. Cameroon’s economy is one of the largest in central Africa, but growth has been hit by a two-year separatist uprising in its Anglophone North-west and South-west regions. “We came to the conclusion that our transactional portal as it is run today is not suitable to the current context in Cameroon,” Jumia said in a statement announcing that its e-commerce operations there had been suspended. Jumia’s shares have tumbled from its Wall Street debut price of $14.50 in April and its last week’s third-quarter results missed revenue estimates for the second time in three quarters. With an e-commerce business similar to Amazon’s and a classified portal like Alibaba’s, Jumia sells its own stock, taking a cut of third-party transactions on its website. A source at the company in Cameroon said it had chosen to prioritize growth over profitability, which had not paid off. “We wanted to see how business evolved. We can come back, but for now we’re closing (to have) time to study the market,” the source, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The International Monetary Fund said in November that economic growth in oil-producing Cameroon was likely to slow to 3.9% this year from 4.1% in 2018 due to a subdued performance by the country’s non-energy sector. And U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he would end Cameroon’s preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) from January because the government had not dealt with abuses by the security forces. Cameroon’s government and military have rejected the allegations and have said that Anglophone separatists are responsible for human rights violations."

"NTSB cites Uber, driver in fatal crash",0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XT2IL,"NTSB cites Uber, driver in fatal crash. With full context: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. safety agency on Tuesday faulted Uber for inadequate attention to safety and decisions in the company’s autonomous vehicle development in an investigation into the first-ever death involving a self-driving vehicle, which also cited the vehicle’s distracted back-up driver. The National Transportation Safety Board said state and federal regulators need to do more to safeguard drivers, noting a “lack of federal safety standards” for automated driving systems. The crash in March 2018 killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was walking a bicycle across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona. The crash prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry. “The collision was the last link of a long chain of actions and decisions made by an organization that unfortunately did not make safety the top priority,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said. The board criticized a series of decisions by Uber that it said were the result of “ineffective safety culture” at the time. The NTSB voted 3-0 that the probable cause was the failure of the back-up safety driver to monitor the driving environment “because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone.” She was behind the wheel and was supposed to act in the event of an emergency. In March, prosecutors in Arizona said Uber was not criminally liable in the self-driving crash. Police, who have said the crash was “entirely avoidable” and that the operator was watching “The Voice” TV program at the time of the crash, are still investigating. Nat Beuse, head of safety for autonomous vehicle efforts of ride-sharing company Uber, said the company remains “committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program” after making significant improvements. Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash’s cause, the NTSB said. The software did not properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian, it did not adequately assess safety risks, and did not address “operators’ automation complacency.” It also deactivated the Volvo XC90’s automatic emergency braking systems in the test vehicle and precluded the use of immediate emergency braking, relying instead on the back-up driver. Volvo found in 17 of 20 simulation tests the crash was avoided, the NTSB said. The board also cited the pedestrian’s crossing outside a crosswalk and Arizona’s insufficient oversight of autonomous vehicle testing. “SAFETY CULTURE” CONCERNS The NTSB urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require entities testing self-driving vehicles to submit a safety self-assessment report to the agency and for the agency to determine if those plans include appropriate safeguards. It said states should do more to oversee the vehicles. The NHTSA said it would carefully review the recommendations, adding, “It’s important for the public to note that all vehicles on the road today require a fully attentive operator at all times.” The NHTSA is also probing the Uber crash. The board said companies actually submit the assessments and some offer little useful information. NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said the NHTSA was failing to properly regulate automated vehicles. “In my opinion they’ve put technology advancement here before saving lives,” Homendy said. While Uber has made significant improvements, Sumwalt will tell a U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday he has broader concerns. “We remain concerned regarding the safety culture of the numerous other developers who are conducting similar testing,” Sumwalt’s testimony seen by Reuters said. In the aftermath of the crash, Uber suspended all testing of self-driving vehicles. It resumed testing last December in Pennsylvania with revised software and significant new restrictions and safeguards. Some critics have questioned the focus on a single pedestrian death when U.S. pedestrians killed in vehicle crashes hit a 30-year-high in 2018, to almost 6,300. The board is also investigating several crashes involving Tesla Inc’s driver assistance system, Autopilot, including a fatal crash in March 2018 in California. The NTSB last year revoked Tesla’s party status to the investigation after the agency clashed with Tesla and the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly ended a call. Sumwalt praised Uber’s cooperation. “I did notice that when I talked to their CEO he did not hang up on me,” he said. “It would be easy just to thumb it off. Blow it off. Say, NTSB, they’re wrong, they’re bad, and hang up on us. But Uber has not done that.” Tesla did not immediately comment."

Mediaset CEO upbeat on reaching accord with Vivendi,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XZ1K9,"Mediaset CEO upbeat on reaching accord with Vivendi. With full context: COLOGNO MONZESE, MILAN (Reuters) - The head of Italian broadcaster Mediaset MS.MI is upbeat about reaching a deal to end a three-year legal battle with major shareholder Vivendi VIV.PA, providing the French media giant does not move the goalposts. Vivendi and Mediaset are locked in a series of legal spats including over the Italian firm’s plans to create a pan-European TV champion through the merger of its Italian and Spanish units into a Dutch holding company called MediaForEurope (MFE). On Friday, a Milan judge gave the two sides another week to settle their dispute over MFE after attempts to reach an accord ahead of the hearing had failed. But Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi told reporters on Monday: “If what we learned today from the talks is kept to, we are very optimistic.” He did not give details. Vivendi, Mediaset’s No. 2 shareholder, fears the plans to set up MFE would give too much power to the Italian group’s main shareholder Fininvest, which is owned by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Pier Silvio Berlusconi, son of Silvio, said Mediaset needed to grow, adding the creation of a large European broadcaster was the only sure way to achieve this. “Mediaset will press ahead with its European growth plans in any case and if it’s not via a merger or a Dutch holding company then we’ll do it in another way,” he said. According to sources familiar with the matter, Vivendi is in talks to sell back to Mediaset roughly two-thirds of its 29% stake in the Italian broadcaster but differences over price remain. Failure to reach a deal over pan-European TV plans could complicate Mediaset's efforts to tackle increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon Prime AMZN.O."

Sales of grounded Boeing 737 MAX gather pace at Dubai Airshow,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Z10L,"Sales of grounded Boeing 737 MAX gather pace at Dubai Airshow. With full context: (Corrects low-cost unit’s name to FlyArystan, para 2 and 6) DUBAI, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Boeing’s 737 MAX took centre stage at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday as airlines announced plans to order up to 50 of the jets worth $6 billion at list prices despite a global grounding in place since March. Kazakhstan flag carrier Air Astana said it had signed a letter of intent to order 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets for its FlyArystan subsidiary. Air Astana, which operates Airbus and Embraer jets in its main network, said it was confident in Boeing’s ability to resolve problems with the MAX. Global regulators banned commercial flights of Boeing’s fastest-selling jet in March after two fatal accidents. Plans for the jet’s return to commercial service have been pushed back to early 2020 as Boeing finalises software and training revisions that need regulatory approval. “We are making flying affordable for the people of Kazakhstan,” Air Astana Chief Planning Officer Alma Aliguzhinova told reporters, adding that budget carrier FlyArystan would start taking the jets in late 2021. The airline plans to hold 15 aircraft directly and may finance the rest through a lease transaction, she said, adding that Air Astana would not change the composition of its main fleet. Separately, another airline signed a firm order for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 10 Boeing MAX 10 jets, a person familiar with the matter said. The airline’s name was not disclosed. Boeing has used the past two major industry events to try to secure market momentum for the grounded MAX, which is seen as key to the planemaker’s financial health over the coming decade. A letter of intent between Boeing and British Airways owner IAG for 200 jets, which grabbed the spotlight at the Paris Airshow in June, has yet to be finalised as the European holding company discusses the fleet change with subsidiaries that currently use Airbus for medium-haul operations. In other business coinciding with the largest Middle East air show on Tuesday, Saudi budget airline Flynas agreed to buy long-range A321XLR jets. The airline’s chief executive had said on Monday that Flynas was in talks to exercise purchasing options for some or all of 40 Airbus A320neo narrowboday jets. Airbus unveiled a provisional order in Dubai for 8 of its small A220 jets from Air Senegal. Britain’s easyJet exercised options for 12 more Airbus A320neo aircraft. Also coinciding with the show, leasing giant GECAS was expected to confirm an order for 25 Airbus planes, including 12 A330neo jets powered by engines from Rolls-Royce, a competitor to GECAS parent company General Electric. However, there were no immediate signs that Dubai’s Emirates was ready to finalise a provisional order for 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, part of a complex set of interlocking deals driving fleet changes at the world’s largest international airline. The fate of the order hinges on negotiations over the larger Boeing 777X, for which Emirates is the largest customer. Emirates has indicated it wants to restructure the order after delays and sources say it could use the pending 787 deal as leverage. (Writing by Tim Hepher Editing by Jason Neely and David Goodman)"

With full context: (Reuters) - Canada's TC Energy TRP.TOTRP.N said on Tuesday it expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to exceed C$10 billion ($7.57 billion) in 2022, driven by long-term contracts and assets. The forecast represents an EBITDA increase of more than 16% from what the company reported for 2018. The Keystone pipeline operator also said it expects dividend to grow at an average annual rate of 8% to 10% through 2021 and 5% to 7% beyond 2021. TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, has been investing heavily in the disputed 830,000 barrel per day (bpd) Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to boost export volumes from the oil marketing hub of Alberta to U.S. refineries. Earlier this month, the company said that its Keystone pipeline has returned to service after a leak in North Dakota spilled more than 9,000 barrels. The company also said on Tuesday it would no longer issue additional common shares from treasury under its dividend reinvestment program. The company is scheduled to host its annual investor day later on Tuesday."
UPDATE 1-Qualcomm expects 5G phone sales to double in 2021,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N27Z4OY,"UPDATE 1-Qualcomm expects 5G phone sales to double in 2021. With full context: (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc expects global smartphone makers to ship 450 million 5G handsets in 2021 and another 750 million in 2022, the world’s largest supplier of mobile phone chips said on Tuesday. Qualcomm said 5G adoption will be faster than 4G due to the timing of commercialization of the technology in China and availability of chipsets across different price tiers. Going by Qualcomm’s previous forecast of a range between 175 million and 225 million 5G devices for next year, the 2021 forecast suggests 125% growth from the midpoint of the 2020 outlook. Analysts attach importance to occasional smartphone estimate figures from Qualcomm, given its close relationship with phone makers. Verizon Communications Inc , in a presentation to analysts after markets close, said it expects revenue from 5G growth opportunities to increase next year and anticipates launching 5G in more than 30 cities by the end of this year. Next-generation 5G smartphones are expected to make tasks like watching videos or playing games on mobile networks as good as or better than on a Wi-Fi connection. Qualcomm and its rivals stand to benefit from faster 5G adoption because the phones will require more chips to gain the speed boost."

BP expects to keep Azeri ACG oil output stable as Shah Deniz gas powers ahead https://t.co/dcNqW5BxVN https://t.co/a0y3sr6K0u,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN204242,"BP expects to keep Azeri ACG oil output stable as Shah Deniz gas powers ahead. With full context: BAKU (Reuters) - BP plans to ramp up production at Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas field and maintain stable output at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields this year, a senior regional official at the British oil major said on Monday. Both ACG and Shah Deniz are operated by international consortiums led by BP and provide significant revenue for the former Soviet country, though BP has had to work hard in recent years to counter ACG’s dwindling reserves. A BP-led consortium last week said that it produced an average of 535,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil at ACG last year, totaling 26 million tonnes, down slightly from 584,000 bpd, or 29 million tonnes, in 2018. Natural gas from the Shah Deniz offshore field was 16.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) and condensate output was 3.5 million tonnes, up from 11.5 bcm of gas and 2.5 million tonnes of condensate in 2018. “Both gas and condensate production will continue to ramp up,” Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP’s vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told Reuters. He said that daily production and Shah Deniz’s Alfa platform was 22.5 million cubic meters (mcm) and “this will remain stable”, while the field’s Bravo platform had been producing 33.5 mcm per day and “this will continue to ramp up throughout the year”. Aslanbayli said the consortium’s drilling at Shah Deniz II would extend for the next few years until production reaches a plateau of 16 bcm of gas and 120,000 bpd of condensate. BP continues works on slowing the natural decline at ACG, which is currently off plateau, and Aslanbayli said that the new $6 billion Azeri Central East (ACE) project will help to offset lower output from ACG. “The new platform will be technically advanced and will use automation to drive efficiency,” he said. Aslanbayli said that ACE is expected to deliver about 300 million barrels of oil by 2049. He said that BP’s other projects in Azerbaijan in 2020 include ongoing exploration drilling at the Shafag-Asiman offshore block as well as 3D seismic acquisition on block D-230 and plans to begin drilling at the Shallow Water Absheron Peninsula (SWAP) exploration area."

With full context: (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate 3M Co MMM.N is exploring a sale of its drug delivery systems unit, which could fetch around $1 billion, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The company is currently working with an adviser to run an auction process for the business, Bloomberg reported, adding that the business is likely to draw interest from private equity firms. A 3M spokeswoman said the company does not comment on rumors and speculations. Shares of the company rose about 4% to $171.01 in morning trading. 3M’s drug delivery business, which manufacturers inhalers and skin patches, accounted for about 1.4% of the company’s 2018 revenue of $32.77 billion. Sales from the business were flat on an organic local currency basis in the recently reported third quarter. The company, known for its Scotch tapes and Post-it notes, reported third-quarter revenue well below analysts’ estimates and cut its full-year profit forecast in October, signaling that American corporations are suffering from the protracted trade war with China."

Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS23C,"Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf airlines Emirates and Air Arabia spent a combined $30 billion at list prices on Airbus AIR.PA jetliners as the Dubai Airshow burst into life on Monday, while Boeing BA.N won a symbolic first official order for the 737 MAX since its grounding in March. Emirates threw its weight behind the Airbus A350 with an expanded order for 50 jets worth $16 billion, but shelved plans to order the slightly smaller A330neo as the Middle East’s largest carrier embarked on a more diversified fleet structure. The firm order, signed in front of reporters on day two of the Nov 17-21 show, drew a line under the A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest airliner which Airbus had decided earlier this year to close, prompting Emirates to order mid-sized planes. Under its original plans tentatively announced in February, Emirates would have ordered 40 upgraded A330neos and 30 slightly larger A350-900s. It decided instead to opt for 50 of the lightweight A350s, citing in part the impact on lower emissions. “Together with the A380, the A350 will give us more capacity and flexibility. We will be able to expand to new markets with these aircraft,” Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said. Analysts said the deal cemented the position of the A350 at Emirates after it canceled a previous order for A350s in 2014. But it also raised questions over production rates for the once highly profitable A330 family, which has been aiming for a new lease of life after switching to new Rolls-Royce engines. Shares in Airbus fell 1.5%, lagging a slightly weaker European market. Airbus builds 50 A330s a year or 4.2 a month. That figure could slip closer to 3 a month from 2022, one analyst said. NO ‘A350NEO’ The A350 gives Emirates greater room for growth than the A330neo though the airline has not definitively shut the door on the jet, an update to A330 models it has operated before. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied reports that Airbus is also looking at a future engine upgrade of the A350, something experts warn might dampen current demand for the jet. But Monday’s business left unanswered questions over the fate of 40 competing Boeing 787 jets also provisionally ordered by Emirates. Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates remained in talks with Boeing on firming up the order. But industry sources said that could come at a cost to Boeing since Emirates would in exchange reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year, which the airline complains is holding back its growth. Reflecting growth among budget carriers, Sharjah-based Air Arabia ordered 120 Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets in a deal worth around $14 billion, the biggest in terms of units so far at the Middle East’s largest aerospace event. Airbus and Boeing are pushing for order endorsements from customers that have been frustrated with plane and engine makers over delays in deliveries and engine issues. Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets due to production glitches. Faury told reporters on Monday A321neo deliveries should return to normal in 2021. Boeing is trying to turn the corner over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. Turkey's SunExpress THYAO.IS announced a $1.2 billion deal for 10 more 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered. It was the first firm MAX order since it was grounded in March and confirmed a Reuters report that a deal was close. British Airways-owner IAG signed a surprise letter of intent in June to order 200 MAX, dropping its medium-haul supplier Airbus, but the deal has not yet been finalised."

ArcelorMittal willing to re-commit to Ilva steel plant on three conditions - paper,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS0O6,"ArcelorMittal willing to re-commit to Ilva steel plant on three conditions paper. With full context: ROME (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS is drafting a plan to re-commit to the 2018 deal, under which it bought the troubled Ilva steel plant in southern Italy, on three conditions, Il Messaggero daily reported on Monday. After withdrawing from the contract, the world’s biggest steel maker is drafting a proposal for Italy’s government in which it will demand the reintroduction of legal immunity, the possibility to revise its industrial plan and the layoff of 5,000 workers. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has postponed a meeting with ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal, due this week, hoping that a Milan court will already decide on an appeal filed by Rome last Friday, Il Messaggero said. The report added that economy minister Roberto Gualtieri is examining the potential entrance of state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti in the shareholding of the Franco-Indian company that manages Ilva."
"ArcelorMittal, commissioners extend talks on Ilva plant - Reuters",2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2A739T,"ArcelorMittal, commissioners extend talks on Ilva plant Reuters. With full context: MILAN (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS and commissioners of the Ilva steelworks in southern Italy have agreed to extend talks to the end of the month after making progress towards a possible deal to buy the plant, a lawyer for the company said on Friday. The world’s biggest steelmaker had tried to walk away from a 2018 deal after parliament scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks during a clean-up of the heavily polluting factory. But the steelmaker has since returned to discussions. “Negotiations between the two parties have made a significant step forward and set a new deadline to Feb. 28,” ArcelorMittal lawyer Ferdinando Emanuele told reporters. The future of the plant has been a headache to successive Italian governments, which have faced the challenge of balancing the need to clean up years of environmental damage with protecting thousands of jobs in the economically struggling south. A Milan court was scheduled to discuss on Friday a government bid to stop ArcelorMittal’s withdrawal from the plant, but the hearing has been postponed to March 6 in order to let the two parties reach a final deal, the lawyer added. Asked if ArcelorMittal could still walk away from Europe’s biggest steel plant, the lawyer said: “I’m not aware. We’re here to negotiate”. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government and ArcelorMittal agreed last year to develop a new industrial plan for the site that employs about 8.200 workers in the city of Taranto."

Boeing announces additional order for 737 MAX planes,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS1OQ,"Boeing announces additional order for 737 MAX planes. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Turkey's SunExpress THYAO.IS announced on Monday it is buying an additional 10 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered, endorsing the U.S. planemaker's grounded jet. The billion dollar new order, announced at the Dubai Air Show, is Boeing's second 737 MAX order after a deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March led to the worldwide ban of the MAX fleet. British Airways-owner IAG ICAG.L signed a letter of intent for 200 737 MAX planes in June. Leisure airline SunExpress, a joint venture of Turkish Airlines THYAO.IS and Lufthansa LHAG.DE, said in a statement that it signed the additional order on Monday and that the purchase was valued at $1.2 billion according to list prices. The airline expressed confidence in the jet’s capabilities and its return to service, even as Turkish Airlines has been critical of Boeing during the 737 MAX crisis. “We believe this was and is the right decision for SunExpress in order to survive and be successful... The economics and the ecological advantages of this aircraft are valid and confirmed,” Chief Executive Officer Jens Bischof said. He has the support of the company’s shareholders for a 737 MAX order, he said. In 2014 SunExpress ordered 32 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft which have not yet been delivered. Turkish Airlines took delivery of 12 737 MAX jets from an order of 75 planes before the aircraft was grounded in March."

The order shake-up completes a fleet review at the host chairman carrier that also saw Europe’s Airbus leave the largest Middle East air show with a mixed result in wide-body orders from the world’s largest buyer of wide-body long-haul jets. Emirates tentatively ordered 40 Dreamliners in 2017 but “tough” talks to finalise the order this week had hinged on negotiations over the fate of a massive separate order for 150 777X after the latter ran into delays.

Exclusive: Russia's VTB plans to expand grain business and then exit - CEO,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XT14H,"Exclusive: Russia's VTB plans to expand grain business and then exit CEO. With full context: MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's VTB bank VTBR.MM, which is expanding in commodities in a bid to create a national grains champion, will exit the sector once it has built up the assets in the next few years, its CEO told Reuters. Andrey Kostin also said in an interview that VTB plans to start trading wheat via its Swiss operation and that it is in the final stage of talks to purchase half of the Taman grain terminal on the Black Sea. VTB, Russia’s second largest bank, is now a major physical grain exporter after buying a local grain trader in August, and became the largest operator of Russia’s grain export terminals and other infrastructure this year. “Oil is going to run out one day but not the grain,” Kostin said in the interview, conducted last week and authorized for publication on Tuesday. “With that in prospect over the next few years, while the business is being built, we will still act as a player in the grain market.” In June the state-controlled bank asked President Vladimir Putin to help it create a Russian grains champion to curb the role of foreign traders and give the state greater control over exports, according to a June 26 letter seen by Reuters. However, Kostin told Reuters that once the business has been built up, VTB plans to hand it over. “We have not finished the expansion yet. We do not rule out building new grain terminals in the Black Sea,” Kostin told Reuters. “After we consolidate and wrap up this business, we will exit these assets,” he said. He did not elaborate on the options to leave the business or potential future owners. In its letter to Putin, VTB said it would need another two to three years to consolidate and acquire more grain assets. The bank plans to start trading wheat through its “fairly well-developed commodities trade business in Zug (Switzerland)”, Kostin said, adding that supplies to Russian traditional buyers - the Arab countries and Vietnam - have been its main focus. VTB is also in the final stage of talks to purchase half of the Taman grain terminal from Ukraine's Kernel group KER.WA, Kostin said. Global trade giant Glencore GLEN.L owns the other half of the terminal, located in Russia's part of the Black Sea. Kostin, who said he sees his bank as a “kind of investment fund” backing the state in big and complicated deals, told Reuters he believed the grain market “should be civilized, with transparent processes.” “Recently, Vietnam suspended Russian wheat imports due to its low quality... In the end the reputation of all Russian grain exporters suffers,” Kostin said, adding that VTB’s goal was to create trust between grain producers and buyers over margins and quality. “To achieve this, you need a qualitative infrastructure, serious and quite large players, including in trade.” This month, VTB exchanged debts with Sberbank SBER.MM, taking on the latter's 50 billion rouble ($784 million) exposure to steel and coal producer Mechel. The miner said in August that it had asked VTB, Sberbank and Gazprombank to push back debt payments to 2024-2026 from 2020-2022. The debt exchange deal left VTB and Gazprombank as Mechel’s two biggest creditors. Mechel has also agreed to pay around 30 billion rubles for Gazprombank’s 34% stake in the Elga coal project and needs to find cash to pay for it. “We said this from the very beginning: we don’t want to manage Mechel. Looking into the future, Mechel is quite an effective company,” Kostin said. VTB does not plan to give Mechel a loan to buy Gazprombank’s stake in Elga, he said. VTB also holds a 22% stake in En+ Group ENPLq.L, after the bank became part of the deal helping En+ avert U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controlled the company, last year. The sanctions were lifted in early 2019. Kostin said that VTB may consider selling its stake in En+ once the company’s shares rise in price from the current $9 per share, adding that the bank may also consider selling its En+ stake to another state entity if such an opportunity arises."

NYC pension leader targets three utilities over emissions plans,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XU1G9,"NYC pension leader targets three utilities over emissions plans. With full context: BOSTON (Reuters) - New York City’s top pension official has called on three major U.S. utilities to name independent board chairs, pressuring them to “decarbonize” their operations by 2050 and underscoring how power companies have split on whether to set such goals. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees about $208 billion in retirement assets, recently filed shareholder resolutions at Southern Co, Duke Energy Corp and Dominion Energy Inc. The resolutions call for shareholder votes on whether to name independent individuals to chair boards currently led by the chief executive of each company. The change would be “useful to oversee the strategic transformation” of the companies to operate in a low-carbon economy, according to the resolutions, seen by Reuters. U.S. power utilities have largely embraced the idea of cutting emissions to slow climate change, but have split on what exact targets to spell out. A number of utilities, including Xcel Energy Inc and NRG Energy Inc, plan to end emissions by 2050 by using more solar or wind power, retiring coal-burning plants, or reaching “net-zero emissions” with offsets like restoring forests to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Some experts have questioned, however, if new technologies for nuclear power, battery storage or carbon capture will be ready in time to make a 2050 target realistic. (bit.ly/35cRFik) Southern and Dominion have both outlined plans to reduce carbon emissions but have not pledged to end them by 2050. To achieve such a state, “technology will have to evolve beyond where we are today,” Dominion CEO and Chairman Thomas Farrell said at a March investor meeting. A Dominion spokesman said the company is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. A Southern company spokesman said it is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. “We regularly engage with our shareholders and look forward to having a dialogue regarding these matters as well,” said the spokesman. Duke said in September it aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Stringer’s proposed resolution acknowledges the step but notes the utility’s continued spending on natural gas infrastructure. A Duke spokesman said the utility is reviewing the proposal. The majority of S&P 500 companies have an independent board chair, according to Stringer’s office, viewed as a way to improve corporate oversight. Calls to separate the roles of chair and CEO have become a flashpoint at some annual meetings, such as at JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose leader, Jamie Dimon, won bruising votes to keep both roles.[reut.rs/359MIqK] The resolutions mark an escalation from the approach Stringer and other investors took for the 2019 proxy season, when they only requested utilities move to net-zero emissions by 2050.[nL1N20M1X7]"

Replacing Pratt engines in IndiGo fleet by end of January a challenge: CEO,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N27Y2EW,"Replacing Pratt engines in IndiGo fleet by end of January a challenge: CEO. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Replacing all Pratt & Whitney engines on IndiGo’s fleet of almost 100 Airbus planes by Jan. 31, as ordered by India’s aviation watchdog, will be challenging but the airline aims to complete the work, its chief executive officer said on Monday. India's aviation regulator on Nov. 1 ordered IndiGo INGL.NS to replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, following recent inflight engine shutdowns that caused ""serious concern"". “It’s a challenge. But we have every intention of meeting it. Pratt is helping us and we are trying to make that work as fast as we can,” Ronojoy Dutta, IndiGo CEO, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Dubai airshow. Low cost carrier IndiGo is Airbus' AIR.PA biggest client for A320neo planes, and while the United Technologies' UTX.N P&W engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times. In June, IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, dropped P&W in favor of French-U.S. engine venture CFM by agreeing a record $20 billion deal for more than 600 engines to power Airbus jets already on order. In October IndiGo placed an order for another 300 A320neo-family jets but it has yet to decide the engine provider - P&W or CFM, which is jointly owned by France's Safran SAF.PA and General Electric GE.N of the United States. “We will be talking to both Pratt and CFM, whoever has the best offer we will give it to them,” Dutta said. IndiGo is focused on growing its international routes and the plane order includes a long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family, A321XLR which will provide the airline with “a lot of growth”, Dutta said. He said ordering widebodies was a distant dream for IndiGo and a part of its five-year plan but no decision had been finalised. Dutta also said that a dispute between the airline’s two promoters and largest shareholders, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, was having no impact on the company. “Both promoters are very much unified in their strategy for expansion. Let’s grow fast, let’s expand international, they agree with that completely,” Dutta said."

With full context: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Four Democratic leaders on the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce committee on Monday wrote Alphabet Inc’s Google and Ascension Health demanding briefings by Dec. 6 on how patient data the hospital chain is storing on the cloud is used. Google’s cloud computing unit said last week that it has incorporated industry standard security and privacy practices into its deal with Ascension, and that none of the data is being used for advertising purposes. But House Energy Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. along with members Anna Eshoo, Diana DeGette and Jan Schakowsky, said in their letter that questions remain about what data exactly is stored with Google, which Google employees have access to the data, and to what extent patients were informed about the companies’ agreement."
UAE says Emirates pilots did not monitor settings in 2016 crash,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2A64DR,"UAE says Emirates pilots did not monitor settings in 2016 crash. With full context: Feb 6 (Reuters) - Pilots of an Emirates passenger jet that crashed in 2016 while attempting to abort a landing in Dubai failed to notice that the Boeing 777’s engine thrust settings remained too low and cut short a procedure, investigators said on Thursday. All 300 passengers and crew were safely evacuated but a firefighter died tackling flames after the Boeing 777-300, arriving from India, caught fire after skidding along the Dubai airport runway on its fuselage in August 2016. The Federal Aviation Authority said pilots of flight EK521 tried to abort the landing after the plane’s main wheels had already touched down, cutting off access to full engine power. “The flight crew did not effectively scan and monitor the primary flight instrumentation parameters during the landing and the attempted go-around,” it said in a final report. It recommended that Emirates enhance go-around training for its pilots and that manufacturer Boeing enhance its crew alerting system and manual to deal with such eventualities. None of the parties concerned was immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Jason Neely)"

With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s BT has told a company promoting digital skills it would continue working with it if it dropped Prince Andrew as a patron. The British royal has been engulfed in a growing scandal since he gave a TV interview on Saturday to discuss his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Andrew denied an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by Epstein but said he did not regret the friendship. He has also been criticized for not showing compassion for his victims. BT, one of Britain’s oldest companies and its largest broadband provider, said it was reviewing its relationship with iDEA, a programme that helps develop digital, enterprise and employability skills. Prince Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, is the company’s patron. “In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage.” Several major companies have also sought to distance themselves from the British royal. Bank Standard Chartered said it would not renew its sponsorship of Andrew’s Pitch@Palace charity while AstraZeneca said its three-year partnership was under review. In Britain, royal patronage is usually considered an honor and a boost for charities."
UPDATE 1-Italian airline Alitalia's rescue in doubt as Atlantia backtracks,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Z66L,"UPDATE 1-Italian airline Alitalia's rescue in doubt as Atlantia backtracks. With full context: MILAN (Reuters) - Italian infrastructure group Atlantia ATL.MI said on Tuesday it was not ready to join a consortium led by Italian railway group Ferrovie dello Stato to rescue loss-making carrier Alitalia, casting a shadow on the entire project. After months of negotiations and with just one day left before a deadline expires, the group controlled by the Benetton family said that the conditions did not exist yet for it to join a consortium working on Alitalia. Atlantia added, however, it remained available to engage in negotiations to seek for an industrial partner for the carrier. A deadline to present a binding offer for Alitalia expires on Thursday, after being postponed several times. Loss-making Alitalia has been run by special administrators since May 2017 and talks led by Ferrovie have been going on for a year without a deal. The carrier, which is burning through its cash reserves, is expected to finish its money at the end of this year. Ferrovie and Atlantia have been in talks with both U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and, recently, with German airline Lufthansa LHAG.DE. Delta said it was ready to invest 100 million euros ($111 million) in the Italian carrier but sources had said it did not agree with Ferrovie and Atlantia over the development of the Italian carrier’s long-haul business. On the other hand, Lufthansa said it was prepared to set up a commercial partnership with the Italian carrier but did not want to take a stake in the group before it has gone through a complete restructuring. “We will not invest in current Alitalia, but we are interested being a commercial partner,” said Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr at an event in Berlin on Tuesday. Italian daily La Repubblica on Tuesday said the airline could be nationalized for some years before being sold. Analysts calculate that Italian taxpayers have spent more than 9 billion euros to support Alitalia, which has undergone two previous failed rescue attempts."

With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf airlines Emirates and Air Arabia spent a combined $30 billion at list prices on Airbus AIR.PA jetliners as the Dubai Airshow burst into life on Monday, while Boeing BA.N won a symbolic first official order for the 737 MAX since its grounding in March. Emirates threw its weight behind the Airbus A350 with an expanded order for 50 jets worth $16 billion, but shelved plans to order the slightly smaller A330neo as the Middle East’s largest carrier embarked on a more diversified fleet structure. The firm order, signed in front of reporters on day two of the Nov 17-21 show, drew a line under the A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest airliner which Airbus had decided earlier this year to close, prompting Emirates to order mid-sized planes. Under its original plans tentatively announced in February, Emirates would have ordered 40 upgraded A330neos and 30 slightly larger A350-900s. It decided instead to opt for 50 of the lightweight A350s, citing in part the impact on lower emissions. “Together with the A380, the A350 will give us more capacity and flexibility. We will be able to expand to new markets with these aircraft,” Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said. Analysts said the deal cemented the position of the A350 at Emirates after it canceled a previous order for A350s in 2014. But it also raised questions over production rates for the once highly profitable A330 family, which has been aiming for a new lease of life after switching to new Rolls-Royce engines. Shares in Airbus fell 1.5%, lagging a slightly weaker European market. Airbus builds 50 A330s a year or 4.2 a month. That figure could slip closer to 3 a month from 2022, one analyst said. NO ‘A350NEO’ The A350 gives Emirates greater room for growth than the A330neo though the airline has not definitively shut the door on the jet, an update to A330 models it has operated before. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied reports that Airbus is also looking at a future engine upgrade of the A350, something experts warn might dampen current demand for the jet. But Monday’s business left unanswered questions over the fate of 40 competing Boeing 787 jets also provisionally ordered by Emirates. Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates remained in talks with Boeing on firming up the order. But industry sources said that could come at a cost to Boeing since Emirates would in exchange reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year, which the airline complains is holding back its growth. Reflecting growth among budget carriers, Sharjah-based Air Arabia ordered 120 Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets in a deal worth around $14 billion, the biggest in terms of units so far at the Middle East’s largest aerospace event. Airbus and Boeing are pushing for order endorsements from customers that have been frustrated with plane and engine makers over delays in deliveries and engine issues. Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets due to production glitches. Faury told reporters on Monday A321neo deliveries should return to normal in 2021. Boeing is trying to turn the corner over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. Turkey's SunExpress THYAO.IS announced a $1.2 billion deal for 10 more 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered. It was the first firm MAX order since it was grounded in March and confirmed a Reuters report that a deal was close. British Airways-owner IAG signed a surprise letter of intent in June to order 200 MAX, dropping its medium-haul supplier Airbus, but the deal has not yet been finalised."

AT&T takes on $5.5 billion loan to boost 'financial flexibility' https://t.co/ENTHbld55o https://t.co/BsoQHzpzao,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21P2I8,"AT&T takes on  billion loan to boost 'financial flexibility'. With full context: NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. T.N on Tuesday announced a $5.5 billion term-loan agreement, which it said would give the company ""financial flexibility"" during the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. telecoms and media giant also reaffirmed its commitment to pay a dividend, which helped send its shares up 2.8% in morning trading. AT&T has been targeted by shareholder activists over its large debt load, accumulated over a buying spree that transformed it into a media and telecoms conglomerate. It said on its investor page that the new loan agreement, with five banks, would “provide additional financial flexibility to an already strong cash position.” AT&T spent $85 billion on Time Warner in 2018. It bought satellite TV service DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015, but the unit has continued to bleed customers. Under pressure from shareholder Elliott Management, AT&T announced a strategic plan in October to sell up to $10 billion worth of businesses in three years. AT&T closed 2019 by reducing its debt by $20.3 billion. AT&T currently holds about $151 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2019. Last month, AT&T stopped its $4 billion share repurchase plan as it re-evaluated the impact of the coronavirus on its business."

With full context: * ECCL credit line for most euro zone countries under discussion * Credit line would pave the way for unlimited ECB bond-buying * ESM involvement intended mainly to calm markets BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone ministers will discuss on Tuesday the possibility of governments applying for a credit line from the bloc’s bailout fund to fight the coronavirus crisis, a move that would also pave the way for unlimited ECB bond purchases if needed. Finance ministers and the European Central Bank have a teleconference at 1730 GMT but officials cautioned it was unclear if decisions could be taken now or if they would require the input of EU leaders who hold talks on Thursday. Euro zone officials are worried that as the pandemic spreads and the euro zone sinks into a deep recession this year, financial markets could start demanding a high price for lending to governments, putting some of the most highly indebted countries like Italy under a lot of strain. The idea under consideration is therefore that either all, or most, euro zone countries would apply for a precautionary stand-by credit called the Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the bailout fund, which has an unused lending capacity of 410 billion euros. Governments would not draw on the ESM credit, but hold it in reserve to keep sovereign bond yields at manageable levels when they finance themselves on the market, because investors would know governments have a cheap financing alternative. Crucially, an ECCL would open the way for the European Central Bank to step in with unlimited bond purchases, if it deemed this necessary. The ECB is allowed to do so for the bonds of any country with such a credit line, under its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme created in 2012. One of the difficulties in agreeing on the standby credit option on Tuesday is the conditions attached to it - any country applying would face a debt sustainability analysis by the European Commission. Italy, which has a public debt of 137% of GDP that is only likely to grow given the country is likely to get into a recession this year, is unhappy about EU institutions scrutinising its debt. The ECCL would also have to entail other conditions, some of which could be politically problematic. To make them more palatable, officials say they could be tightly focused on issues relating to the epidemic, rather than general macroeconomic problems, and introduced gradually or with a delay. Yet, Italy, Greece and Spain insist the credit line from the ESM should be without any conditions, while Germany, Finland, the Netherlands or Austria, say money cannot be lent with no strings attached. “I wouldn’t hold my breath,” one senior euro zone official said of the likelihood of a decision being taken on Tuesday. “Discussions are ongoing but the usual suspects (southern and northern euro zone countries) are not aligned yet on the best way forward.” Officials also note that the urgency of a decision has been diminished by the ECB’s own coronavirus emergency bond-buying programme worth 750 billion euros and the fact that all euro zone governments can still borrow very cheaply on the market.

Earnings heatmap https://t.co/gY9oNC5zPW,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WQ0HQ,"Earnings heatmap. With full context: LONDON/TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some European and Japanese bond investors are taking on more currency risk by buying dollar debt without protecting themselves against potentially devastating exchange rate swings as they seek ways to compensate for sub-zero yields at home. A fund manager in Germany can buy 10-year U.S. Treasuries that offer minimal credit risk at yields of up to 1.6%, more than 2 percentage points more than for German Bunds. But that juicier yield is available only if she eschews expensive currency hedging that could wipe out that whole premium -- a vulnerable position that funds have traditionally avoided for fear of adverse exchange rate swings. Hedging dollar exposure is expensive -- at current prices, the German investor’s 2.2% yield pick up on 10-year Treasuries would become a 0.3% loss after hedging. With some 40% of non-U.S. debt -- about $15 trillion -- now yielding less than zero, however, it’s a risk that funds --especially those with obligations to insurance policyholders and pensioners -- seem prepared to take. “For fixed income investors, the normal habit is to hedge currency risk, but this year we’ve seen a tendency to hedge less,” said Claire Dissaux, head of global strategy at fund Millennium Global, which helps clients manage FX exposures. “If you are a euro zone investor, it’s expensive to hedge (dollar exposure) so there has been a temptation to not hedge. And if you didn’t hedge you will have done well.” (GRAPHIC: Sovereign bond yield heatmap - ) Hedges are usually implemented via currency forwards that specify the rate at which a currency may be exchanged over the contract period -- usually three or six months. That effectively shields the fund if the foreign currency depreciates against its base currency. Funds rarely disclose their hedging strategies but interviews with money managers and advisors, data on hedged and unhedged bond returns, and exchange rate moves imply the ratio of unhedged debt holdings in portfolios has been rising. A survey of corporate clients by U.S. bank Wells Fargo showed 35% of FX exposure was hedged in 2018, versus 47% in 2016, indicating a broader decline in hedging appetite. Japan’s $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) recently decided to reclassify FX-hedged foreign debt as domestic, giving itself leeway to buy more foreign debt -- including “scope to increase buying of FX-unhedged foreign bonds”, Barclays analysts wrote. A yen-based investor currently earns a 196 bp yield pickup on 10-year Treasuries -- but a 0.5% loss after hedging costs. For an interactive version of the below graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/31u7eRl. (GRAPHIC: Losing appeal - ) Japanese funds bought 2.57 trillion yen ($23.76 billion) of U.S. bonds in July, official data shows, the most in a month since July 2016. With little reliable data, investors often use exchange rate moves to draw conclusions on hedge ratios. Because hedging effectively offsets the purchase of an FX asset by selling the same currency in forward markets, a currency may strengthen more if it is not being sold for hedging purposes. Dissaux said the U.S. dollar’s resilience in the face of interest rate cuts and slowing growth is partly due to investors not hedging their dollar exposure. Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan, says the dollar-yen exchange rate has a fairly stable correlation to the yield gap between 10-year Treasuries and Japanese government bonds. “But in September the dollar has shifted about one yen above the usual correlation and it rose further in the last couple of weeks, which suggests unusual factors are driving up dollar/yen,” he added. “Unhedged foreign bond buying by Japanese investors is the most likely culprit.” For an interactive version of the below graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/2ZZ4b6p. (GRAPHIC: Going West - ) The shift is important because bond investors are a risk-averse bunch. Pension and insurance funds desire slim but steady returns -- and holding bonds unhedged can jeopardize that. When U.S. bonds yielded around 5% and the Treasury yield curve was steep, hedging costs ate less into returns. But a flattening of the curve since 2016, so that long-maturity debt yields barely more than short-dated bonds, has crushed post-hedging yields, said Ugo Lancioni, managing director for global fixed income at Neuberger Berman. For an interactive graphic, please see tmsnrt.rs/2OE7XvX (GRAPHIC: BUY AMERICAN - ) “(Curve flattening) has forced Japanese and other investors to buy bonds on an increasingly unhedged basis ... if you were to hedge your FX risk completely, what you earn on the long end you can lose by hedging on the short end,” Lancioni said. Although it is unusual for hedging costs to eliminate the yield advantage of a foreign security, the gap between U.S. interest rates and those in Europe and Japan -- on which the cost of forwards is based -- mean no change is likely soon. Collapsing currency volatility is another factor. With big FX swings now relatively rare, it’s become less risky for bond investors to run unhedged portfolios. “The Fed has not pushed the button (on U.S. interest rates) and said we’re going to zero, like in Europe and Japan. So if you’re looking to take on dollar exposure, it’s probably still to your advantage to enjoy the full interest rate differential,” said Tim Horan, chief investment officer for fixed income at Chilton Trust in New York. Some would call the strategy reckless. Dollar positioning, valuations and the low-volatility backdrop have reached extremes, meaning any reversal could be bloody. The dollar meanwhile faces headwinds from Fed rate cuts and President Donald Trump, who blames currency strength for U.S. trade woes. “By leaving all of your global bonds unhedged, currency risk will dominate in your portfolio ... You may lose the integrity of a fixed income portfolio,” said Ben Popatlal, multi-asset strategist at Schroders. Do clients usually know what currency risks they face? Popatlal said active managers tend to have discretion over portfolios, with clients kept informed of strategy shifts. “Our neutral starting point is to be 100% hedged and then take active decisions away from that, such that every currency earns its place in the portfolio,” he added."

Oil drops https://t.co/xb3srmfsWj https://t.co/I5DioT0KQk,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2X1015,"Oil drops. With full context: May 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell by more than a dollar a barrel on Wednesday, ending a three-day rally, as economic data suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve might hike interest rates further. Brent crude dropped $1.03, or 1.3%, to settle at $76.41 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $1.15, or 1.6%, to $72.56 a barrel. U.S. consumer prices rose in April, potentially raising the likelihood that the Fed will maintain higher interest rates. Rising global interest rates have weighed on oil prices in recent months, with traders concerned about recession. ""Oil prices have been depressed by fears about economic growth related to the banking crisis and normal seasonal weakness during the spring as energy demand moderates,"" said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management. U.S. crude oil inventories rose by about 3 million barrels last week due to another release from national reserves and a drop in exports, the Energy Information Administration said. The government report confirmed industry data released late Tuesday that had reported an unexpected build, which weighed on prices for most of Wednesday's session. [API/S} Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a crude drawdown of 900,000 barrels. The surprising U.S. crude inventory build, along with lower crude imports and April's softer export growth in China exacerbated worries about global oil demand. The decline in crude prices was, however, limited by a surge in U.S. gasoline demand ahead of the summer driving season. U.S. gasoline inventories fell by 3.2 million barrels last week, much bigger than the 1.2 million-barrel draw forecast by analysts. Distillate stocks also declined, EIA data showed. RBOB gasoline futures rose 0.7% to $2.50 per gallon, while the ULSD futures contract was unchanged. ""We are forecasting that oil prices range from $75-95 during 2023 based on fundamental supply and demand and that oil will rally as we head into the summer driving season,"" Hatfield said.

Saudi Arabia tanker power play could backfire as oil demand shrinks https://t.co/NccWYluy4I https://t.co/5u2SO81qM2,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2BC7LA,"Saudi Arabia tanker power play could backfire as oil demand shrinks. With full context: * Saudi charters record number of ships for extra output * High freight, demand collapse deters buyers * Contango play difficult as high freight costs weigh LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Top exporter Saudi Arabia has chartered an armada of ships to flood the market with additional oil, but in the process has driven freight costs so high refiners are reluctant to take the shipments. That could leave the kingdom stuck with tens of millions of barrels in expensive ships at anchor when the coronavirus outbreak has destroyed oil demand and international prices have lost more than half their value compared with the start of the year. Following the failure to persuade Moscow to support deeper output cuts at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+ early this month, Saudi Arabia said it would increase output to record levels in a fight for market share. Shipping industry sources say Saudi Arabia has booked as many as 25 supertankers and provisionally chartered another 15 vessels, to send oil to new and old customers to undercut Russia. Together the ships can carry 80 million barrels of oil - almost equivalent to a day of global demand. The rush for ships sent tanker rates soaring, prompting the kingdom to tell its buyers it would abandon its usual policy of providing compensation for freight jumps, making Saudi’s deep discounts less attractive. Several European majors and refiners are engaged in talks with Aramco to try to cut April crude purchases, four trading sources told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Saudi Aramco declined to comment. It has yet to be seen whether the world biggest oil company has miscalculated or has a winning strategy that will effectively deprive its rivals of many vessels. Aramco traditionally stores crude inland at its own hubs, such as Ras Tanura, and in major Asian, U.S. and European consuming centres, where it has storage and pays relatively little compared to the current tanker rates. Now it needs to store at sea. “Floating storage is the only way to handle extra oil if the Saudis are testing what they have never done before - record exports of 10 million barrels per day,” a Western consultant who was briefed on Saudi policies said on condition of anonymity. Floating storage is usually dominated by the oil majors and trading houses, which charter ships to store oil they produce or buy cheaply from the market, betting they can resell at a profit when prices recover. The strategy is known as a contango play, referring to the oil market structure when cargoes for short-term delivery are cheaper than those for later delivery. It can earn players tens of millions of dollars, as in 2009 when more than 100 million barrels was held at sea. But Riyadh’s chartering frenzy is unlikely to give it the benefits of such a contango play and could also lock out the traditional speculative players, who even at the best of times have to pay for storage, insurance and the cost of moving oil. The rush for ships pushed tanker rates to record levels of more than $200,000 a day over the last 10 days. They are still above $100,000 a day, versus an average of around $40,000 a day over the last year. According to traders’ estimates, the high freight rate environment requires a 12-month contango premium of at least $15 per barrel. On Monday, Brent’s 12-month future-to-prompt-month premium was around $10 per barrel. Oil traders will also have to pay a premium for time charters, or leasing for extended periods. “Someone who was looking to take a time charter three weeks ago for possible storage would have paid around $30,000 a day and could have made a profit doing that or re-letting the tanker into the market for $200,000 a day,” Richard Matthews, head of research with ship broker E.A. Gibson, said. “If someone wanted to take a VLCC (very large crude carrier) for even three months currently it will cost around $110,000 a day. The contango would probably only support $90,000 a day.” Some traders are undaunted. Trading house Glencore has chartered one of the world’s only two tankers able to carry 3 million barrels of oil for floating storage, while oil major Royal Dutch Shell has taken two VLCCs for sea storage because of the glut.

"Exxon and Papua New Guinea should return to LNG negotiating table, says Total CEO",2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2001PH,"Exxon and Papua New Guinea should return to LNG negotiating table, says Total CEO. With full context: ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and the Papua New Guinea government must return to the negotiating table so that a $13 billion expansion of gas production can proceed, the head of French oil major Total TOTF.PA, a partner in the plan, said on Thursday. The plan, which would double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the South Pacific nation, hinges on agreements to develop two new gas fields, but PNG walked away from talks with Exxon on one of those fields last week. The other agreement, with Total TOTF.PA, was sealed last September. It is intended that gas from the two fields would be processed at an expansion of the existing Exxon-operated PNG LNG plant in Port Moresby. “Our project is joint with that of Exxon,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters after Total reported full-year results on Thursday. “There is a need for an agreement and the PNG government is aware of that. “We have an agreement; they need to find an agreement. All of that needs negotiation, I don’t think negotiations should be done through media.” LNG expansion is crucial for the impoverished nation, but the government has said that Exxon refused to budge on the financial terms for the P’nyang field and failed to come up with an offer it could accept. Exxon has expressed disappointment at the breakdown of talks but has said it hopes to work towards an outcome that would be beneficial to all stakeholders. The company’s press representative in PNG and the Prime Minister’s office had no immediate response to Pouyanne’s comments when contacted outside business hours on Thursday. “Fundamentally, the two projects are good. Fundamentally, PNG wants the projects to go ahead, now it is a question of negotiation,” Pouyanne added. “I’m convinced they’ll reach an agreement. It is a question of patience.” Total beat profit forecasts on Thursday by keeping net adjusted profit for the fourth quarter steady at $3.2 billion, lifting shares in the French energy major."

"Despite OPEC+ deal collapse, Saudi oil exports yet to rise-sources https://t.co/kPGWllrMqi https://t.co/47FpVRrhMY",2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21A321,"Despite OPEC+ deal collapse, Saudi oil exports yet to rise-sources. With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has yet to boost crude shipments significantly, two industry sources who track the flows said, suggesting a lack of demand despite a deep slide in prices as major producers battle for market share. The kingdom plans to ship more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) from May following the collapse of a supply-cut pact by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia, known as OPEC+. So far, exports in March are running significantly below that rate, the sources said, showing little change from February. This could reflect lower demand from customers, such as China following the coronavirus outbreak. “Saudi March exports are so far in the 7.3 million bpd region, not more,” one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. “Total supply is way below 10 million bpd.” Another source who tracks the exports said Saudi shipments in February would be about 7.2 million bpd. Tanker data from Refintiv Eikon put the exports even lower, at just below 7 million bpd so far in March. Saudi oil exports averaged 7.26 million bpd in February, according to Kpler, a supply tracking firm, which told Reuters that as of March 23, the 10-day moving average was 6.8 million bpd. One of the two industry sources put the February crude shipments at 7.4 million bpd, while the second estimated them at 7.3 million bpd. Three years of cooperation between OPEC, Russia and other producers ended in acrimony on March 6 after Moscow refused to support deeper cuts to cope with the outbreak of coronavirus. OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production. Brent crude has dropped below $25 a barrel to the lowest since 2003 because of the demand collapse and the start of a fight for market share among major exporters. [O/R] Saudi Arabia made a steep cut in its official selling price for April-loading crude, and plans next month to reduce operations at local refineries to boost the potential for increased crude exports. Before the OPEC deal collapsed, Riyadh had been over-delivering on its share of the output curb, reporting production of 9.78 million bpd in February, below its OPEC target of about 10.14 million bpd."

Trump says US will 'help Mexico along' with its OPEC+ production cuts. https://t.co/NdNXHiJV3E,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN21S1XM,"Trump says US will 'help Mexico along' with its OPEC+ production cuts.. With full context: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States would “help Mexico along” with oil production cuts that it is meant to make under a global deal to shore up slumping crude oil prices, but said the details had yet to be worked out. The comments suggest that Trump could be considering an unprecedented effort to orchestrate a production cut in the United States, historically the world’s most vocal proponent of the free market. “What I thought I would do, and I don’t know that it is going to be accepted, we’ll find out, the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they are prepared to do so,” Trump said during a White House briefing on the coronavirus. Trump said he spoke to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador about the issue on Thursday. “And we had a great conversation and we’ll find out how that all works out,” Trump said. The group of oil producers known as OPEC+, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, had hammered out the framework of a record oil cut on Thursday to lift oil prices slammed by the coronavirus crisis. But efforts to conclude the deal had hit the barriers when Mexico refused to sign up to a 400,000-barrel-per-day cut in full. President Lopez Obrador said earlier on Friday that Trump had agreed help out by cutting additional U.S. output after Mexico offered OPEC+ a cut of just 100,000 bpd, a quarter of what the group demanded. He said Trump “very generously said to me that they were going to help us with the additional 250,000 (bpd) to what they are going to contribute.” Trump had been a vocal proponent of global supply cuts, seen as crucial to saving the U.S. drilling industry from collapse, but has resisted calls that the United States also orchestrate a reduction in supplies - saying U.S. drillers were already slowing their output for economic reasons. U.S. laws forbid companies from colluding to reduce supply and raise prices, but does not prevent the government from ordering such supply reductions.

"Volkswagen cuts profit, sales forecasts as autos downturn bites",0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Y43N,"Volkswagen cuts profit, sales forecasts as autos downturn bites. With full context: HAMBURG (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE cut its forecasts for operating profit and sales growth on Monday due to a downturn in demand for passenger cars, while keeping profit margin targets. “It is fair to say that the very best of the party is over,” Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter told analysts in a call to discuss the company’s outlook. Volkswagen joins a string of automakers and suppliers including Ford F.N and Continental CONG.DE in warning of tough times for an industry facing higher investments into cleaner and self-driving technologies at a time when a trade war between Washington and Beijing is curbing global growth. Volkswagen now expects operating profit before special items to rise by at least 25% over 2016-2020, down from a previous forecast of more than 30%, presentation slides showed. The Wolfsburg-based company also cut its forecast for sales growth over the period to 20% from more than 25%. The new forecasts sent Volkswagen shares down 4% to 176 euros, compared with a 0.6% fall in Germany's blue-chip DAX .GDAXI index. “We believe this largely reflects softer volume growth expectations,” Citi analysts said in a note. Volkswagen, whose brands range from budget Skodas and Seats to upmarket Audis and Porsches, confirmed its targets for an operating margin of 6.5%-7.5% in 2019-2020 and 7%-8% in 2025. To counter the cost of rolling out electric cars, the company will increase sales of higher-margin sport-utility vehicles and work on lowering the cost of producing electric vehicles, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said. Volkswagen’s new ID.3 electric vehicle, for example, will be 40% cheaper to build than the electric version of its Golf model, he told investors. As the battery pack in the new ID.3 can be used to add structural rigidity, some savings can be made to the vehicle body. Furthermore, the modular layout of the battery aids efficient packaging and economies of scale, he added. Volkswagen said it would start producing the ID.3 in Dresden as well as in Zwickau, eastern Germany. Electric cars will reach cost parity with gasoline and diesel variants from about 2025 onwards, the company said, helping to deliver profit margin targets."

"Samsung first-quarter beats estimates; chips likely to prop up virus-hit second-quarter - Reuters

https://t.co/ogYnZF6u6X",1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21O35T,"Samsung first-quarter beats estimates; chips likely to prop up virus-hit second-quarter Reuters. With full context: SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit likely managed to rise slightly from a slump a year earlier, as solid chip sales helped cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic on smartphones and TVs. The global leader in semiconductors is benefiting from higher demand for chips from laptop makers and data centres amid the coronavirus-driven shift to working from home, even as its mobile and consumer electronics businesses suffer. Samsung said operating profit was expected to be 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the quarter ended March, compared with 6.2 trillion won a year ago and the 6.2 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. Revenue likely rose 5% to 55 trillion won from a year ago, in line with the 55.6 trillion won estimate. Samsung Electronics shares were 2.3% higher while the broader market .KS11 was up 1.9%. The maker of smartphones, TVs, appliances, memory chips and displays is the first global tech company to report its January-to-March quarter earnings estimates. Samsung Electronics said last month the coronavirus would hurt sales of smartphones - which accounted for about 47% of its revenue last year - and consumer electronics in 2020, while demand from data centres would fuel a recovery in memory chip markets. “Even though Samsung’s mobile business was hit by the coronavirus outbreak this quarter, it will likely face bigger challenges in the second quarter - now that the United States and Europe have become the hardest-hit countries,” Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities, said. When the coronavirus outbreak started in China last year, Samsung’s strategy of spreading its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off as supply disruptions in China hit rivals such as Apple. But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States. NH Investment & Securities said on Tuesday it expected sales of Samsung’s premium Galaxy 20 smartphone to reach 20 million units this year, far short of the 32 million it had forecast earlier. LG Electronics 066570.KS, Samsung's crosstown rival in TVs, phones and appliances, meanwhile said its first-quarter operating profit likely rose 21% to 1 trillion won. Analysts expect the coronavirus to affect LG this quarter. Samsung Electronics did not provide a breakdown of earnings for each division in its guidance released on Tuesday. Analysts say the company’s memory chip business, which generated more than 50% of its operating profit in 2019, would likely report better-than-expected results in the first half of this year. Memory chip prices are rising as work-from-home requirements boost demand from the data centres that support internet services such as streaming and cloud computing, analysts have said. Prices for DRAM memory chips are up more than 3.5% since January, according to industry tracker DRAMeXchange. “If the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t die down in the third quarter, demand for memory chips might face a bump,” said Song Myeong-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.

With full context: ABERDEEN, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French energy major Total said on Thursday that its net adjusted profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was steady at $3.2 billion compared with the same period a year ago, supported by strong cash flow, despite low oil prices. “The group reported solid fourth quarter 2019 results with DACF (debt-adjusted cash flow) at $7.4 billion, an increase of more than 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018,” Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. Total’s oil and gas production grew by 9% in 2019 compared with the previous year thanks to a ramp up in projects, while its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business doubled. Pouyanne said the group rewarded shareholders with a 6% increase of the final dividend for 2019 to 0.68 euros per share. It bought back $1.75 billion of its shares in 2019 and plans to buy back $2 billion of its shares in 2020 with oil at $60 per barrel. (Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Alexander Smith)"

"Twitter notches first $1 billion quarterly revenue, beating estimates",1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2001N0,"Twitter notches first  billion quarterly revenue, beating estimates. With full context: (Reuters) - Twitter Inc pulled in $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time on Thursday, beating expectations as efforts to make its platform more user-friendly brought in more people, and sending its shares up 14% in early trading. Twitter recorded most of its revenue growth in the United States, a major market where the company will face scrutiny this year over how it tackles misinformation ahead of the presidential election in November. The company has continued efforts to boost sign-ups through measures such as allowing people to follow topics, and by trying to clean up abusive content. Late last year, it launched a feature for users to hide certain replies on their tweets. Twitter has also focused on relevant content and notifications, which has boosted average monetisable daily active users (mDAU), or users who see ads when logged in through twitter.com or Twitter applications. That metric rose to 152 million in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31 from 126 million a year earlier, beating the average analyst expectation of 147.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares were up 14% at $38.03 in early trading. Quarterly revenue here grew 11% from a year earlier to $1.01 billion, also beating the expectation of $996.7 million. Total advertising revenue was $885 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. The company, however, forecast first-quarter revenue between $825 million and $885 million, largely below the Wall Street estimate of $872.6 million. Rolling out new features at a faster pace is one of Twitter’s top priorities for the year, Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said during an earnings call with analysts. “The time it takes to go from an idea to shipping something remarkable to customers simply takes too long,” he said. Twitter also posted fourth-quarter net income lower than expectations, at $119 million, or 15 cents per share, down from $255 million a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 25 cents a share, below the expectation of 29 cents. Twitter’s total U.S. revenue rose 17% to $591 million, compared with a 3% uptick in international revenue. In November, Twitter banned political ads amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting commercials containing misleading or false information. But this week’s Iowa caucuses showed the platform was still being used to spread false allegations of voter fraud. On Tuesday, Twitter said it would apply “false” warning labels to tweets containing synthetic or deceptively edited forms of media and remove such media if it is likely to cause harm. Quarterly total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 22% year-over-year to $854 million, partly due to a planned increase in headcount. Twitter said its total costs and expenses would increase 20% this year as it also plans to build a new data server, which executives said would help the company test new products and release them faster. “Their guidance for an increase in operating expense means they won’t grow profits as fast as they have in the past,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, adding he believes investors are currently more interested in the company’s user growth. The company expects first-quarter operating income of between breakeven and $30 million."

With full context: STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Volvo Car Group, owned by China’s Geely, reported an 18% rise in fourth-quarter operating profit as cost cuts and growing sales more than offset the impact of subdued global auto markets. The Gothenburg-based carmaker, which Geely acquired from Ford Motor Co F.N in 2010, reported operating earnings of 5.29 billion Swedish crowns as revenues rose 8.4% to 79.2 billion. Sales of Volvos rose nearly 10% in 2019 - with growth of 23.4% in the fourth quarter alone - as increases in China and the United States and strong demand for a line of SUVs, its best-selling models, gave a boost. “During the second half of the year, and specifically during the fourth quarter, both profit and profit margin outperformed the comparative period in 2018,” Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. “This is a result of continued strong growth in volume, especially in SUVs, as well as cost efficiency measurements initiated early in 2019.” Automakers have been under pressure over the past year, contending with heavy investment needs in the electric and self-driving technology that is seen reshaping the industry in the years to come, as well as softer demand in many major markets. While Volvo has also faced higher capital spending needs, which it has sought to offset with 2 billion crowns of cost cuts, its niche position in the premium market and continued expansion in China have left it fairly unscathed by a broader slump in car sales."

Oyo reported a net loss of 23.85 billion rupees ($332 million) in the year to March 2019, compared with a loss of 3.6 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the report filed with India’s ministry of corporate affairs. Revenue from operations surged to 64.57 billion rupees ($900 million) from about 14.13 billion rupees a year earlier. Oyo said in a statement the report contained only “certain provisional financials” for the year ending March 2019. “These are not the final audited financials and the same will be issued later by the company along with the annual report that we issue every year.” The report, prepared by a valuer in Gurugram, just south of New Delhi, said the financials for the year to March 2019 were unaudited and all figures were provided by Oyo’s management. The growing losses at Oyo come as its major investor SoftBank struggles to raise funding for a second investment fund in the wake of the failed listing of office-rental company WeWork and amid questions about the path to profitability of other marquee investments like Uber. SoftBank, which has invested nearly $1 billion in Oyo through its Vision Fund, this month reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at the Vision Fund. Oyo’s operating expenses grew nearly five-fold year-over-year to 61.32 billion rupees, while total expenses hit 90.28 billion rupees, the report showed. Gurugram-headquartered Oyo, valued at $10 billion, allows guests to book hotels through its mobile app and charges partnering hotels a fee on room revenue. It also franchises its brand and offers standardized amenities at hotels on its network. ($1 = 71.7700 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; Editing by Rashmi Aich, Bernard Orr)"

Small U.S. businesses were already struggling. Then coronavirus hit https://t.co/hT3SLBlI3c https://t.co/vMqjAebRe4,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21P34U,"Small U.S. businesses were already struggling. Then coronavirus hit. With full context: (Reuters) - Many small businesses were struggling with funding shortfalls and financial challenges even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, leaving them with little cash on hand to weather the slowdown caused by the virus, according to data released by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. Many small firms, particularly the smallest businesses and those owned by black and Hispanic entrepreneurs, also lack traditional banking relationships, which could make it more difficult for them to receive financial assistance during the crisis. “Small businesses nationwide now face unprecedented challenges as the country grapples with the significant economic and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Claire Kramer Mills, assistant vice president at the New York Fed, said in a statement. The majority of small employers reported growing revenue last year and more than a third even expanded their staffs, according to the 2019 survey here of more than 5,500 small firms issued by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. However, two-thirds of the businesses said they faced financial challenges last year, according to the report, which focused on businesses with fewer than 500 employees. In a supplemental brief here, researchers at the New York Federal Reserve assessed the ability for small businesses to cope with a substantial hit to revenue, categorizing firms according to their financial health - a metric based on their profitability, credit scores and earnings. Among the ""healthy"" firms, only about 20% had enough cash saved to continue operating as normal after losing two months' worth of revenue. Most small businesses surveyed by the Fed said they would have to shrink their staffs, delay payments or scale down operations after taking such a hit. Many firms would need to go into debt or turn to personal funds to close the gap. That hypothetical scenario - two months without revenue - posed to businesses owners at the end of last year is now a reality for many firms, which closed down or substantially reduced their operations because of nationwide efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. A new $349 billion small business bailout fund launched last week to shore up businesses with fewer than 500 employees got off to somewhat rocky roll out last week after some banks grappled with unclear rules and inconsistent government infrastructure. Some banks initially said they were prioritizing existing customers, putting some small business owners at a potential disadvantage for the first-come, first-served program. Only 44% of small businesses had turned to a bank for a loan in the past five years and just 6% had turned to a credit union, according to the Fed survey. Businesses with more than $1 million in annual revenue and those with white owners were more likely to have used banks for funding, while smaller businesses and those with black or Hispanic owners were more likely to have used online lenders."

Santa Claus rally,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1OG01T,"Santa Claus rally. With full context: NEW YORK (Reuters) - Broad stock declines in Europe and the United States dragged world equity markets lower on Monday, adding to a sell-off that has sent global stocks near 17-month lows. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped nearly 1.3 percent as declines in U.S. and European markets offset modest gains in Asia overnight. Wall Street’s Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 506.71 points, or 2.1 percent, to 23,593.8, the S&P 500 lost 54.09 points, or 2.08 percent, to 2,545.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 156.93 points, or 2.27 percent, to 6,753.73. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap U.S. companies fell 2.3 percent, pushing the index into the 20 percent decline from its highs that signals a bear market. “If Santa Claus doesn’t turn up very soon, U.S. stocks may end this year in negative territory”, wrote Rabobank analysts as the Nasdaq remained the only benchmark in the black for the year, with the Dow and the S&P 500 down between 2 and 3 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes from London and Milan to Paris and Frankfurt have lost between 10 percent and 17 percent so far this year. Some investors had hoped for a bounce back before the holidays, but any “Santa Claus rally” has proven elusive so far. Since 1950, Wall Street has rallied by an average of 1.3 percent during the last five trading days of December, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. “Some investors whom we have spoken to had positioned themselves for a December rally and the path has been painful,” broker Bernstein said in a research note. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates again at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, but what matters more for investors will be whether it cuts its guidance on rate increases in 2019. The U.S. central bank now projects three more increases before 2020, but recent weak data and worries over Washington’s protectionist policies have fueled expectations the central bank will cut its guidance. In China, where the economy has been losing momentum, investors will look to a speech by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday marking the 40th anniversary of China’s “reform and opening” policy. China is also expected to hold its annual Central Economic Work Conference later this week, where key growth targets and policy goals for 2019 will be discussed. The top decision-making body of the Communist Party, the Politburo, said last week that China will keep its economic growth within a reasonable range next year, striving to support jobs, trade and investment while pushing reforms and curbing risks. In foreign exchange markets, moves were moderate. The dollar paused near 18-month highs before the Fed meeting, after it gained from a rush into safe-haven assets due to the economic outlook. The dollar index fell 0.31 percent, with the euro up 0.33 percent to $1.1344. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.8606 percent, from 2.889 percent late on Friday. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on signs of oversupply in the United States, with investor sentiment under pressure from concern over the prospects for global economic growth and fuel demand.
